They have grey, leathery skin, and are completely hairless. Trolls often bear tattoos or other markings that serve as a record of their lives: where they have lived, their proudest accomplishments, and so on. These patterns can become very extensive and complex over time, as trolls are extremely long-lived; trolls living in Faerie simply do not age once full-grown, and even those who have entered the material world can live to be 200 years old.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Troll children grow and learn quickly by human standards, and are considered adult at the age of 12, ready to take on the burden of a guardian. In Faerie, young trolls usually experience a geas, calling them to a worthy task. Trolls living in the material world often send their children out into the world when they come of age, giving them a chance to find their own purpose.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Long before the Sidhe rose to power within Faerie, the trolls were guardians over places of power. Some watched over the paths and roads through Faerie (which, incidentally, is the source of stories in which trolls live under bridges). Others cared for nexuses of power and the places where it was possible to cross into the material plane. A few even protected relics, powerful objects awaiting heroes (or villains) to use them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">This changed when the lords of Caras Elvaren crossed into Faerie and became the Sidhe. With their newfound gifts, they sought out and claimed many of the trolls&rsquo; places of power, displacing or killing the guardians. Some trolls took service with the new lords of Faerie, but many others were left without a home or purpose. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The trolls now living on the Material Plane are a diverse group. Some are looking for a new purpose in life: they wander the world looking for places, objects, or people that they deem worthy of their protection. Others are biding their time until they can return to Faerie and take up their old callings. And a few have given up on their old way of life entirely, selling their deadly skills to the highest bidder.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Those trolls that remained in Faerie are mostly opposed to the realm&rsquo;s new rulers: they live in remote holdouts that openly defy the Sidhe, or they have joined up with other resistance groups: gnomes, renegade elves, and the occasional band of mortals who wander into Faerie and are drawn into the conflict. These trolls are single-minded in their desire to return Faerie to the &ldquo;old ways.&rdquo; A minority of trolls have joined up with the Sidhe, though: they are a mix of downtrodden, hopeless conscripts, and a handful of treacherous, forsworn trolls who joined up voluntarily and were rewarded with positions of power.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Trolls are connoisseurs and crafters of magical weapons, armor, and other items. Aside from guarding their powerful relics, trolls often make lesser magical items for individuals who have proven their worth and earned their trust. To be gifted a troll-made weapon or suit of armor is a token of enormous respect, and many trolls will seek out and reclaim their work if it is ever stolen or sold.</span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

However, goblins are surprisingly resistant to injury, and possess a wiry strength that makes them dangerous&mdash;especially when underestimated. Many goblins of both genders are completely hairless; when a goblin does have hair, it is generally black or a very dark brown.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Despite their similar sizes, goblins are seldom mistaken for halflings or gnomes. Goblin skin tones range from red-brown to gray, and they have strangely-proportioned bodies, with arms that reach past their knees. Goblins also have alarmingly wide mouths and an assortment of sharp, mismatched teeth&mdash;most individuals of other races find goblin smiles unsettling.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Goblins grow quickly, and are physically mature by the age of 12. Mentally, however, they do not reach maturity until 18 to 20 years old. &ldquo;Adolescent&rdquo; goblins have their full adult strength, but lack wisdom and foresight.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Goblins have not had a unified society since the collapse of their empire, Gobol Karn, a century before the Collapse. Modern goblins live in primitive tribes, or as second-class citizens in nations where other races are the majority. Regardless of where they live, goblins are hardened by harsh conditions and brutal competition.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The tribal goblins are most common in the far south, where ruins of Gobol Karn can still be seen today, but they can sometimes be found in the unsettled hinterlands of other nations. Goblin tribes eke out an existence as hunter-gatherers, or as raiders who prey on other goblins, or other races&rsquo; undefended settlements.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Urban goblins, on the other hand, are found in the slums and tenements of cities, performing the most dangerous and degrading of jobs, or partaking in petty crime. Goblins are sometimes viewed as pests by authorities, due to their numbers and the diseases that they are believed (sometimes correctly) to carry with them. Raids on goblin residences&mdash;or warrens&mdash;to evict or exterminate them are common.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Many goblins, both wild and urban, are fascinated by modern conveniences&mdash;the everyday magic and industrial devices that civilized people flaunt or take for granted. Some goblins develop a more serious interest, and experiment with trinkets and devices that they steal or scavenge&mdash;a few even survive these experiments long enough to gain some understanding. These fortunate pioneers sometimes achieve a degree of respectability as hedge mages or tinkers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The impulse to experiment and tinker is even more pronounced among adolescent goblins&mdash;who, lacking emotional maturity, approach it with even more enthusiasm than their elders. Most goblin tribes try to discourage their children, or at least supervise their efforts, but some indulge them&mdash;with mixed results. Young goblins allowed access to magic, alchemy, or mechanical devices can be extraordinarily dangerous, not necessarily because of malice, but because of the high likelihood that something will go badly wrong.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Virtually all goblins are suspicious of outsiders, especially non-goblin outsiders&mdash;a lifetime of abuse and mistreatment does not make for a trusting personality. But, goblins can be fiercely&mdash;violently&mdash;protective of people who treat them fairly and with respect. Also, although goblins might be cautious, even timid on their own, a mob of goblins in a killing mood should never be underestimated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

Dwarves have the same variety of hair and skin colors as humans, although red and blonde hair is somewhat more common among them. They tend not to cut their hair, which is very thick and voluminous, instead working it into complex braids as a symbol of age and wisdom&mdash;the longer a dwarf&rsquo;s braids, the longer they have lived and the greater the respect they are given. Male dwarves can grow enormously bushy beards, but many choose to shave or keep it trimmed, especially if they work with complex machinery that might snag on facial hair.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Although dwarf children mature at the same rate as humans, dwarves are slow to feel the effects of old age, remaining hale and hearty well into their second century. Many live to be over 200 years old.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Dwarven culture is split into two opposing factions, traditionist and modernist. The traditionists hold on desperately to the remnants of their culture from before the Collapse. They venerate their ancestors, and carefully preserve their knowledge and creations, causing them to be distrustful of technological progress. In addition to the pantheon worshipped by other races, the dwarves follow a form of ancestor worship overseen by a group of historian-priests called the Stonekeepers. The Stonekeepers keep records of a dwarf&rsquo;s accomplishments and deeds, and when a dwarf dies, his clan&rsquo;s Stonekeeper will evaluate what he did with his life to determine if he deserves to become one of the honored dead, immortalized in stone.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">While the dwarves were once the undisputed masters of stonecraft and metalworking, human industry has begun to compete with them. While dwarf artisans are still immensely skilled, the techniques developed by the ancient dwarves remain mostly unimproved-upon, while humans have developed new industrial methods. A person seeking an heirloom-quality weapon that his grandchildren will be proud to use would still do well to seek out a dwarf smith&mdash;but to equip an entire army, people now depend on human foundries, who can produce decent-quality goods quickly and cheaply.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Modernist dwarves have broken with the ancient ways of doing things and started adopting human inventions and improving them with dwarven skill and craftsmanship. Notably, the reloading mechanisms used in military-grade crossbows and firearms were developed by dwarves working for human arms manufacturers. The modernists remain a minority among dwarves, largely due to the Stonefathers&rsquo; condemnation. Many modernists are apprentice artisans, barely past their fourth decade, who have found themselves out of work as business increasingly goes to the humans instead of the master-smiths they work for. As a result, there is a growing expatriate dwarven presence in human cities, where they can find gainful employment&mdash;since even a dwarf apprentice is the equivalent of a skilled laborer among humans.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Both dwarven cultures place heavy emphasis on family relationships and form tight-knit extended family groups known as clans. Most dwarven businesses are owned by clans, rather than individuals, and most clans specialize in a handful of trades, training their children to follow in the family business. Young dwarves with talents that don&rsquo;t line up with their clan are often traded or sold to more fitting clans, although these days, the money is usually given to the young dwarf in question as a parting gift. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Dwarves in general appreciate a good day&rsquo;s work, followed by a stiff drink. They form close friendships, especially when they&rsquo;ve been separated from their clan for a while, and are fiercely loyal. </span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

While it is not possible to bargain away a child&rsquo;s soul, parents can consent to have a demon&rsquo;s mark placed upon their unborn offspring. The resulting hellbound have a tenuous connection to the Abyss, causing their physical changes and permitting their demonic creators to send them dreams of unsettling imagery and seductive whispers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The hellbound are created as the result of magic tied to their bloodline, and as a result, hellfire&mdash;the raw, destructive power of the Abyss&mdash;runs in their veins. When they are cut, hellbound spray boiling blood which often ignites in the air, burning their attackers. Hellbound can also call upon the power in their veins voluntarily, although it still harms them to do so: when unleashing their hellfire, hellbound are burned by it all the same. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\">&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Due to their obvious physical traits, and a very understandable fear and distrust of those who traffic with demons, hellbound have a difficult lot in life. Faced with prejudice from early childhood, many hellbound succumb to the whispers planted in their dreams by the demons which torment them. These unfortunate souls become mortal agents of the Abyss, having many of the powers and protections of demons but few of the restrictions and vulnerabilities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Hellbound who receive support and reach adulthood sane and with their morality intact can be the Abyss&rsquo; most dedicated&mdash;and potent&mdash;foes, however. One of the only ways to silence the demonic whispers in their dreams is to seek out and bind or destroy the demon whose power they channel, and so many hellbound take up the crusade against the Abyss in order to have a chance of confronting their tormentors. Others seek out hellbound children in an effort to protect them from the demonic influence that would corrupt them, or hunt down their fellows to deny the Abyss its mortal agents.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">A few hellbound walk a fine line, gathering personal power in the hopes that they can bargain with their tormentors to finally gain their freedom. Indeed, according to much of the lore, this is the only way for a hellbound to completely rid themselves of their demonic nature&mdash;but even if that is true, there are no records of such an attempt succeeding. More often, hellbound who bargain for their freedom are outwitted by their tormentors, who have centuries or millennia of experience cheating mortals. These unfortunates are bound into service, or simply never seen again.</span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

Boggarts have skin ranging from charcoal-grey to pitch-black, with enormous eyes that are a uniform black. Their hair is similarly colorless, although it can be lighter shades of grey. Some boggarts have light grey markings on their skin or streaks in their hair.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Most boggarts have large, batlike ears and unusually long toes and fingers.

They can live to be about 150 years old, but many cease to age when they join the court of a Gravelord.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Magical Qualities</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Due to the influence of the Underworld, boggarts have an assortment of shadowy characteristics. Their dark flesh already makes them resemble a living shadow; when pushed, a boggart can take this further, becoming fully insubstantial.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">This mutable flesh also allows boggarts to change shape in limited ways; they can make their limbs thinner to escape restraints or bend in unnatural ways to crawl through narrow spaces. Some boggarts take this to extremes, and are able to drastically change height in an instant, shrinking to become the size of a housecat or growing to stand eye-to-eye with an orc.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">When boggarts first made themselves known, about 50 years ago, they were tight-lipped about where they came from. Since then, scholars have pieced together what little they said along with scraps of old records, creating an accepted explanation of their origins.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">From what these scholars have deduced, the boggarts are descended from a goblin expedition into the Underworld, shortly before the Collapse. This expedition suffered casualties during its effort to map the River Styx and recover the soul of a dead goblin emperor, and they lost contact with their base camp and the portal back to the Material Plane. While the expedition attempted to re-establish contact, Gobol Karn suffered one of the dynastic upheavals that led to its eventual collapse, and the expedition was abandoned during the ensuing chaos.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The survivors, trapped in the Underworld, went native in the courts of the dead. Over the course of centuries, their descendants forgot their origins and gained the powers of shadow that they bear today. When another, human, expedition entered the Underworld fifty years ago, groups of boggarts were attracted to their portals, and the light and warmth on the other side. Sneaking into the Material Plane when the expedition members weren&rsquo;t looking, these boggarts hid in the underside of mortal civilization, rediscovering the heritage that they only remembered in legends.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">As more and more boggarts were released from the Underworld, their leaders decided to publicly announce their presence rather than wait until they were discovered. Since then, boggart collectives have popped up in many unlikely places, from tiny halfling farming communities to dwarven strongholds. Untrusting individuals regard this as a sign of some conspiracy.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Many boggarts continue the work that they performed in the service of the Gravelords: they lurk in shadows, snatching misplaced belongings or gathering overheard information for sale to interested parties. Others have begun a mass pilgrimage to the ruins of ancient Gobol Karn, intending to reclaim the homeland that once abandoned them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">In general, boggarts are secretive and evasive. The Underworld is not a pleasant place, and these traits became necessary for their survival during the long years of their exile. Boggarts rarely trust even friends and allies completely, for misplaced trust could endanger their entire collective.</span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

Their hair has mostly the same range of colors as humans, although it tends to be more vibrant. High elves tend towards blonde or black hair, and wood elves are more commonly brown- or red-haired. A very few elves have hair of strange shades, like blue, green or purple, which is typically a sign of sorcerous ancestry. Both male and female elves let their hair grow long.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Elven children mature slightly slower than humans; they are considered mature (physically and mentally) on their 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;birthday. Due to this, elves tend to have a broader education by the time they go out into the world. Once mature, however, their aging slows considerably. Elves do not show signs of old age until they are at least 200 years old; many live to be 350 or older.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">In the aftermath of the Collapse, the elven civilization splintered over their reactions to the catastrophe. The two largest factions came to be known as the High and Wood Elves.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The High Elves wished to continue living much as they had previously. They renounced their former rulers, the Sidhe, who had led them to such ruin, but retained many aspects of the culture that the Sidhe has created: the high elves kept their focus on arcane magic, and when they began to rebuild, they modeled their new nation, Caras Elvaren, on the best parts of their fallen empire, Caras Sidharen.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">High elves value learning and knowledge, especially in the arcane arts. Many high elves dabble in magic, even if their focus lies elsewhere. They also prize arts, music, and theater.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">High elven society is ruled by a council of Houses&mdash;essentially guilds which govern crucial services ranging from providing food and water, to healing the sick and protecting far-flung elven enclaves. Elves who are not part of these guilds are nominally represented by the guild of magisters, ascetic mages who have sworn service to the elven people&mdash;in practice, not all of the guildless are satisfied with this.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">In contrast to the high elves, the wood elves renounced the arcane as the ultimate cause of the Collapse, and withdrew into the deepest forests they could find. There, they lived as hunters and woodsmen. In the first century after the Collapse, this was a bleak existence: they could barely feed their people without using the arcane conveniences that had supported Caras Sidharen. Over time, the wood elves began to use primal magics, forming a bond with the nature spirits which inhabited their forests. These spirits created bountiful, hidden glades and led the elves to plentiful hunting grounds, which provided enough food to bring them back from the brink of starvation. Wood elves tend to learn practical skills due to their humble lifestyles, especially the arts of war; young wood elves are expected to train in archery or swordplay so that they can protect their villages and join in hunting parties. Wood elven art tends to be practical as well; woodcarving and weaving are common trades, although wood elves also have a rich history which is recited in verse by bards.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The wood elves have a reclusive society, nestled in the heart of a primeval forest. In theory, they are ruled by a queen who possesses absolute power, but in practice, the current queen is more interested in hunting and revelry. Actual governance is left to various local lords, as well as various sects of druids, and the way that laws are actually enforced varies widely between regions: some lords are noble and fair, some share the queen&rsquo;s preoccupation with hunting and revelry, and others are wildly xenophobic, preying on any outsider who wouldn&rsquo;t be missed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">High elves tend to be soft-spoken, with impeccable manners. Wood elves are less reserved, at least when they are at home&mdash;but wood elves venturing into the wider world for the first time tend to be somewhat overwhelmed and introverted.

They have the same proportions, the same range of hair, eye, and skin colors, and the same lifespan. Were it not for the fact that halflings are, on average, about 2/3 the height of humans, they would be indistinguishable.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Many halflings choose to go barefoot most of the time, and those that do develop heavily calloused feet&mdash;and, it must be said, a fair amount of foot hair. Prosperous halflings also tend towards plumpness.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">In the era before the Collapse, halflings lived in the lands just north of the goblin kingdom (and later empire), Gobol Karn. As the goblins gained strength, the halflings were faced with ever more frequent slaving raids, until they fled their early settlements and adopted a nomadic lifestyle. Virtually all halflings lived in caravans or on riverboats during the several centuries that followed; even when Gobol Karn collapsed into regicide and infighting, the Collapse took place before halflings were able to refound their earlier societies. Although some halflings have always settled down and joined other races&rsquo; settlements, halflings have only started to establish their own permanent towns in the last hundred or so years.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Halfling caravans travel the length and breadth of the continent, carrying fine goods and fresh news between all nations. What started as a move of desperation is now the mainstay of halfling society. Caravan halflings are cunning traders and wise to the wilderness that they constantly travel; they are welcoming to fellow travelers, but despise brigands and highwaymen with an unmatched passion.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">After the Collapse, a handful of halflings joined groups of humans fleeing from the chaos in the east, who eventually settled near the halflings&rsquo; original homeland. These halflings eventually became founding citizens of Waystone, and as the fledgling city grew, they were granted titles of nobility along with the other &ldquo;first families.&rdquo; Most of these halfling nobles left the city for the surrounding farmland when it became too crowded and elitist for their tastes, but some remained in the city and became prosperous merchants thanks to family ties with caravaneers and country nobles alike. Today, noble halflings form most of Waystone&rsquo;s &ldquo;landed gentry,&rdquo; who seldom come to the great city but possess large rural estates. Other halflings, who arrived in Waystone too late to receive titles, moved with them to work the land, forming tightly-knit farming communities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Despite their humble lifestyles, many halflings are fond of adventure&mdash;even if that adventure just means taking the caravan down a promising new road, or sneaking into a farmer&rsquo;s vegetable patch. Some go on more extensive adventures, disappearing for a few years to visit exotic places and see unusual sights before returning home with stories to tell around the fire&mdash;and perhaps a bit of treasure, as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Regardless of origin, halflings are fond of food and drink, with remarkable appetites for their small size, and they enjoy song, good company, and creature comforts. Whether they live in a merchant&rsquo;s wagon, a grand manor house, or a hole in the hillside, their homes are well-kept and cozy. Halflings will remember their friends long after their last meeting&mdash;a remnant of the days when two caravans might go a decade or two between meetings. On the regrettable occasions that halflings are forced to fight, they are capable of surprising bravery when it means protecting their allies and companions.</span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

Their skin ranges from almost black to nearly snow-white, and covers all the shades of brown in between. Their hair can be any shade of yellow, red, brown, or black, from very pale to very dark, and their eyes can be blue, brown, green, or hazel.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Humans are considered mature when they are 18 years old, and old when they reach 60.

Children of mixed races look mostly human, with a few telltale traits from their other parent: half-dwarves tend to be short and thick-skulled, half-elves tend to be skinny, and might have pointed ears&mdash;and half-orcs are usually big and brawny, with prominent jaws.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Human cultures are just as diverse as humans themselves, but they tend to have a few common traits:</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Humans are hasty. They jump straight into their work and put everything they have into it. Longer-lived races, like elves and dwarves, say that humans do this because they have shorter lives to work with, so they get started earlier&mdash;although less charitable observers suggest that they also don&rsquo;t care whether their work lasts.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Humans are ambitious. They set lofty goals for themselves and embark on monumental projects. This goes for individuals as well as groups&mdash;human civilizations plan, build, and work on a bigger scale than elves or dwarves. Longer-lived races say that humans do this in order to leave their mark on the world&mdash;although another interpretation is that they do it to show superiority over other races.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Humans are adventurous. They wander the world, explore unknown lands, and put themselves into danger. This is one of the reasons why human nations are so widespread&mdash;humans arrived first and put down roots before the other races could stake their claims. Longer-lived races often declare that they do this in order to cram a century of living into the 75 years most of them get, but a common sentiment among anti-human groups is that their expansionism is fueled by necessity&mdash;human populations grow faster than any other race (except possibly goblins).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Humans are inventive. They come up with new ways to solve old problems, and new ways to use old ideas.

All over the world, there are humans living among other races, and other races living among humans. Human cultures freely borrow aspects of other cultures that they enjoy, and there are humans that embrace other cultures so thoroughly that they don&rsquo;t call themselves human anymore. This leads to six-foot-tall &ldquo;dwarves&rdquo; and unusually clumsy &ldquo;elves.&rdquo; Some individuals of other races find this flattering, and others find it insulting.</span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

However, goblins are surprisingly resistant to injury, and possess a wiry strength that makes them dangerous&mdash;especially when underestimated. Many goblins of both genders are completely hairless; when a goblin does have hair, it is generally black or a very dark brown. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Despite their similar sizes, goblins are seldom mistaken for halflings or gnomes. Goblin skin tones range from red-brown to gray, and they have strangely-proportioned bodies, with arms that reach past their knees. Goblins also have alarmingly wide mouths and an assortment of sharp, mismatched teeth&mdash;most individuals of other races find goblin smiles unsettling.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Goblins grow quickly, and are physically mature by the age of 12. Mentally, however, they do not reach maturity until 18 to 20 years old. &ldquo;Adolescent&rdquo; goblins have their full adult strength, but lack wisdom and foresight. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Goblins have not had a unified society since the collapse of their empire, Gobol Karn, a century before the Collapse. Modern goblins live in primitive tribes, or as second-class citizens in nations where other races are the majority. Regardless of where they live, goblins are hardened by harsh conditions and brutal competition.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The tribal goblins are most common in the far south, where ruins of Gobol Karn can still be seen today, but they can sometimes be found in the unsettled hinterlands of other nations. Goblin tribes eke out an existence as hunter-gatherers, or as raiders who prey on other goblins, or other races&rsquo; undefended settlements.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Urban goblins, on the other hand, are found in the slums and tenements of cities, performing the most dangerous and degrading of jobs, or partaking in petty crime. Goblins are sometimes viewed as pests by authorities, due to their numbers and the diseases that they are believed (sometimes correctly) to carry with them. Raids on goblin residences&mdash;or warrens&mdash;to evict or exterminate them are common.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Many goblins, both wild and urban, are fascinated by modern conveniences&mdash;the everyday magic and industrial devices that civilized people flaunt or take for granted. Some goblins develop a more serious interest, and experiment with trinkets and devices that they steal or scavenge&mdash;a few even survive these experiments long enough to gain some understanding. These fortunate pioneers sometimes achieve a degree of respectability as hedge mages or tinkers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The impulse to experiment and tinker is even more pronounced among adolescent goblins&mdash;who, lacking emotional maturity, approach it with even more enthusiasm than their elders. Most goblin tribes try to discourage their children, or at least supervise their efforts, but some indulge them&mdash;with mixed results. Young goblins allowed access to magic, alchemy, or mechanical devices can be extraordinarily dangerous, not necessarily because of malice, but because of the high likelihood that something will go badly wrong. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Virtually all goblins are suspicious of outsiders, especially non-goblin outsiders&mdash;a lifetime of abuse and mistreatment does not make for a trusting personality.

While doing this, you may also alter your physical appearance: this involves making a Deception check, as though putting on a disguise, but its effects are permanent and cannot significantly change your size or conceal the fact that you are Remade (though it can change or conceal your apparent sex).

Most Remade have bodies simply made from clay, but a minority are given bodies with stone or metal embedded in them, in the expectation that they will enter combat. Depending on how much care is taken to make this body, they may look almost lifelike, or be only vaguely humanoid: the finest Remade bodies have sculpted hair, eyes which move, and flesh which yields to the touch, while crudely-formed Remade look more like a crude doll shaped from mud.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">A Remade&rsquo;s artificial body renders them extremely durable: they have hardened clay &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; that acts as armor, and they can survive indefinitely in an inactive state, without fear of bleeding out. Remade are sufficiently lifelike to burn, freeze, and suffer from poison, although they can ignore injuries that would gradually wear down a normal mortal.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Although the Remade may have sexual characteristics if their body was sculpted to have them, roughly a third of Remade have a gender that does not match their body, and another third have a nonbinary gender, or no gender identity at all. The Remade are not capable of reproduction, except by using the same revivification ritual that created them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Remade do not age, and do not die unless killed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Magical Qualities</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The Remade possess a complete soul, but it is either made from fragments stolen from a myriad of other souls, or imprinted with partial copies of those souls&mdash;despite intense scrutiny, no researcher has ever conclusively determined where the soul fragments originate from. In either case, the Remade have fragmentary memories of hundreds or thousands of other lives. These memories are seldom complete enough that a Remade remembers who they were in previous lives; rather, they find themselves possessing a strange assortment of skills and knowledge accrued over lifetimes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The revivification ritual which creates the Remade is known as the Valeo Protocol, after its inventor, Sigismund Valeo. Valeo himself was hunted down and spent his last years in prison after his experiments came to light, but a few copies of his Protocol escaped all attempts to suppress them. The Valeo Protocol is now widely distributed, and while the Remade are not exactly common, they are widespread enough that most nations have granted them rights and freedoms&mdash;even if only to avoid a complicated legal battle.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The Valeo Protocol has only one notable attribute, and that is its ability to recover souls that are years or centuries dead. If the Protocol could be perfectly targeted at only one individual, it would be every vitalist&rsquo;s dream; as it stands, it is only useful to desperate individuals who hope that their loved ones will be one of the rare cases who remember who they are, or to unscrupulous vitalists looking to create a slave workforce.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The Remade themselves do not understand what happened to them: they are created with a full set of adult memories, except that those memories came from multiple deceased individuals. A rare handful of Remade retain large portions of a single individual&rsquo;s memories, and may even consider themselves to be that person, but even they have additional memories from other lives. At the other extreme, some Remade have diverse and wildly conflicting memories, and struggle to reconcile the memories of multiple childhoods, romances, and loyalties. These unfortunates tend to be less lucid, and suffer from symptoms similar to schizophrenia.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Although the Remade each have a primary, default personality that is a composite of all their soul fragments, all of their past lives churn beneath the surface, and can be brought to the forefront by stimulating the right memory. A Remade can find themselves at the mercy of these memories: they may break down in tears at the sight of a flower or the melody of an old song, or fly into an inexplicable rage when confronted with certain foods or a glorious sunset, and they seldom know what causes these reactions.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Many Remade turn to spirituality and religion as a way to cope with their strange existence. Some manage to reconcile their memories, forging a cohesive personality and gaining semi-conscious control over which past life is dominant at any moment. Others revel in their breadth of experience, allowing their dominant personality to change chaotically. Others try to understand who they were before being Remade, and wander the world in an attempt to gain closure for their past selves.</span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

They have the same proportions, the same range of hair, eye, and skin colors, and the same lifespan. Were it not for the fact that halflings are, on average, about 2/3 the height of humans, they would be indistinguishable.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Many halflings choose to go barefoot most of the time, and those that do develop heavily calloused feet&mdash;and, it must be said, a fair amount of foot hair. Prosperous halflings also tend towards plumpness.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">In the era before the Collapse, halflings lived in the lands just north of the goblin kingdom (and later empire), Gobol Karn. As the goblins gained strength, the halflings were faced with ever more frequent slaving raids, until they fled their early settlements and adopted a nomadic lifestyle. Virtually all halflings lived in caravans or on riverboats during the several centuries that followed; even when Gobol Karn collapsed into regicide and infighting, the Collapse took place before halflings were able to refound their earlier societies. Although some halflings have always settled down and joined other races&rsquo; settlements, halflings have only started to establish their own permanent towns in the last hundred or so years.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Halfling caravans travel the length and breadth of the continent, carrying fine goods and fresh news between all nations. What started as a move of desperation is now the mainstay of halfling society. Caravan halflings are cunning traders and wise to the wilderness that they constantly travel; they are welcoming to fellow travelers, but despise brigands and highwaymen with an unmatched passion.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">After the Collapse, a handful of halflings joined groups of humans fleeing from the chaos in the east, who eventually settled near the halflings&rsquo; original homeland. These halflings eventually became founding citizens of Waystone, and as the fledgling city grew, they were granted titles of nobility along with the other &ldquo;first families.&rdquo; Most of these halfling nobles left the city for the surrounding farmland when it became too crowded and elitist for their tastes, but some remained in the city and became prosperous merchants thanks to family ties with caravaneers and country nobles alike. Today, noble halflings form most of Waystone&rsquo;s &ldquo;landed gentry,&rdquo; who seldom come to the great city but possess large rural estates. Other halflings, who arrived in Waystone too late to receive titles, moved with them to work the land, forming tightly-knit farming communities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Despite their humble lifestyles, many halflings are fond of adventure&mdash;even if that adventure just means taking the caravan down a promising new road, or sneaking into a farmer&rsquo;s vegetable patch. Some go on more extensive adventures, disappearing for a few years to visit exotic places and see unusual sights before returning home with stories to tell around the fire&mdash;and perhaps a bit of treasure, as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Regardless of origin, halflings are fond of food and drink, with remarkable appetites for their small size, and they enjoy song, good company, and creature comforts. Whether they live in a merchant&rsquo;s wagon, a grand manor house, or a hole in the hillside, their homes are well-kept and cozy. Halflings will remember their friends long after their last meeting&mdash;a remnant of the days when two caravans might go a decade or two between meetings. On the regrettable occasions that halflings are forced to fight, they are capable of surprising bravery when it means protecting their allies and companions.</span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

Their skin tends to be pale, and sometimes greyish, but orcs living in warm climates become tan just like humans. Orcs have hair in the same shades as humans, but lighter colors are rare&mdash;most orcs have black or dark brown hair. Their eyes also share the same range of colors as human eyes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Orcs also have prominent jaws, with oversized canine teeth. In some cases, these canines are almost tusk-like, and protrude between the lips.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Although they grow up at the same speed as humans, orcs are much tougher, and many live in harsh environments. As a result, young orcs are commonly considered adults as young as 15. Orcs can live to be 100 years old, but not many survive that long.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Orcs suffer from extreme aggression issues&mdash;to put it simply, orcs don&rsquo;t have the &ldquo;flight&rdquo; part of the fight-or-flight response. It is a very bad idea to make an orc angry if you are standing nearby at the time. Some scholars have studied this tendency, and they suggest that orcs naturally over-produce the hormone adrenaline&mdash;this makes them constantly on edge and looking for a fight.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Orcs are stereotyped as primitive, violent brutes, but the truth is more complex than this. Many orcs do live in tribal societies&mdash;but even they have hidden depths, and these days, there are just as many who make a living in cities, doing hard physical labor or similarly unpleasant jobs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Centuries ago, in the middle of a war between the ancient kingdoms of Caras Sidharen and Arcis Aurum, the elves intentionally provoked warlike groups of orcs into attacking their human enemies. This eventually spiraled out of control, and a massive horde of bloodthirsty orcs rampaged out of the east, laying waste to the first civilizations of humans, elves, and dwarves. This was a pyrrhic victory, however: in the end, the horde was broken in the last stand of the dwarf king, and almost two entire generations of orcs lay dead on the battlefield.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">In the east, the orc tribes which had not joined the horde saw a mere trickle of survivors return to their homelands. These tribes, already less warlike than the ones which had marched west, were horrified by the death toll that the survivors reported. In the decades that followed, orc shamans sought to channel their people&rsquo;s violent impulses away from another costly war.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Although it took generations, the shamans eventually succeeded by finding other outlets for aggression: modern tribal orcs are taught from a young age to either control their rage, or vent it in ways that don&rsquo;t leave anyone dead or injured. The tribes that adhere to this way of life emphasize hunting, stylized mock duels, and athletic competition, rather than the glory of battle.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The orcs that remained in the west did not benefit from this cultural shift. These orcs settled in the land they had conquered during the Collapse, and for a while, they lived briefly like kings off of plunder and the labor of their slaves and subjugated vassals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Since then, orcs have been gradually been relegated second-class citizens. Their physical prowess saw them exploited as a source of cheap labor, or conscripted as shock troops by nations that were willing to field them. As the world became industrialized, many were drawn to large cities for the plentiful jobs in foundries and factories.

They have the same proportions, the same range of hair, eye, and skin colors, and the same lifespan. Were it not for the fact that halflings are, on average, about 2/3 the height of humans, they would be indistinguishable.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Many halflings choose to go barefoot most of the time, and those that do develop heavily calloused feet&mdash;and, it must be said, a fair amount of foot hair. Prosperous halflings also tend towards plumpness.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">In the era before the Collapse, halflings lived in the lands just north of the goblin kingdom (and later empire), Gobol Karn. As the goblins gained strength, the halflings were faced with ever more frequent slaving raids, until they fled their early settlements and adopted a nomadic lifestyle. Virtually all halflings lived in caravans or on riverboats during the several centuries that followed; even when Gobol Karn collapsed into regicide and infighting, the Collapse took place before halflings were able to refound their earlier societies. Although some halflings have always settled down and joined other races&rsquo; settlements, halflings have only started to establish their own permanent towns in the last hundred or so years.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Halfling caravans travel the length and breadth of the continent, carrying fine goods and fresh news between all nations. What started as a move of desperation is now the mainstay of halfling society. Caravan halflings are cunning traders and wise to the wilderness that they constantly travel; they are welcoming to fellow travelers, but despise brigands and highwaymen with an unmatched passion.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">After the Collapse, a handful of halflings joined groups of humans fleeing from the chaos in the east, who eventually settled near the halflings&rsquo; original homeland. These halflings eventually became founding citizens of Waystone, and as the fledgling city grew, they were granted titles of nobility along with the other &ldquo;first families.&rdquo; Most of these halfling nobles left the city for the surrounding farmland when it became too crowded and elitist for their tastes, but some remained in the city and became prosperous merchants thanks to family ties with caravaneers and country nobles alike. Today, noble halflings form most of Waystone&rsquo;s &ldquo;landed gentry,&rdquo; who seldom come to the great city but possess large rural estates. Other halflings, who arrived in Waystone too late to receive titles, moved with them to work the land, forming tightly-knit farming communities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Despite their humble lifestyles, many halflings are fond of adventure&mdash;even if that adventure just means taking the caravan down a promising new road, or sneaking into a farmer&rsquo;s vegetable patch. Some go on more extensive adventures, disappearing for a few years to visit exotic places and see unusual sights before returning home with stories to tell around the fire&mdash;and perhaps a bit of treasure, as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Regardless of origin, halflings are fond of food and drink, with remarkable appetites for their small size, and they enjoy song, good company, and creature comforts. Whether they live in a merchant&rsquo;s wagon, a grand manor house, or a hole in the hillside, their homes are well-kept and cozy. Halflings will remember their friends long after their last meeting&mdash;a remnant of the days when two caravans might go a decade or two between meetings. On the regrettable occasions that halflings are forced to fight, they are capable of surprising bravery when it means protecting their allies and companions.</span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

Their skin tends to be pale, and sometimes greyish, but orcs living in warm climates become tan just like humans. Orcs have hair in the same shades as humans, but lighter colors are rare&mdash;most orcs have black or dark brown hair. Their eyes also share the same range of colors as human eyes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Orcs also have prominent jaws, with oversized canine teeth.

As a result, young orcs are commonly considered adults as young as 15. Orcs can live to be 100 years old, but not many survive that long.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Orcs suffer from extreme aggression issues&mdash;to put it simply, orcs don&rsquo;t have the &ldquo;flight&rdquo; part of the fight-or-flight response. It is a very bad idea to make an orc angry if you are standing nearby at the time. Some scholars have studied this tendency, and they suggest that orcs naturally over-produce the hormone adrenaline&mdash;this makes them constantly on edge and looking for a fight.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Orcs are stereotyped as primitive, violent brutes, but the truth is more complex than this. Many orcs do live in tribal societies&mdash;but even they have hidden depths, and these days, there are just as many who make a living in cities, doing hard physical labor or similarly unpleasant jobs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Centuries ago, in the middle of a war between the ancient kingdoms of Caras Sidharen and Arcis Aurum, the elves intentionally provoked warlike groups of orcs into attacking their human enemies. This eventually spiraled out of control, and a massive horde of bloodthirsty orcs rampaged out of the east, laying waste to the first civilizations of humans, elves, and dwarves. This was a pyrrhic victory, however: in the end, the horde was broken in the last stand of the dwarf king, and almost two entire generations of orcs lay dead on the battlefield. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">In the east, the orc tribes which had not joined the horde saw a mere trickle of survivors return to their homelands. These tribes, already less warlike than the ones which had marched west, were horrified by the death toll that the survivors reported. In the decades that followed, orc shamans sought to channel their people&rsquo;s violent impulses away from another costly war. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Although it took generations, the shamans eventually succeeded by finding other outlets for aggression: modern tribal orcs are taught from a young age to either control their rage, or vent it in ways that don&rsquo;t leave anyone dead or injured. The tribes that adhere to this way of life emphasize hunting, stylized mock duels, and athletic competition, rather than the glory of battle.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The orcs that remained in the west did not benefit from this cultural shift. These orcs settled in the land they had conquered during the Collapse, and for a while, they lived briefly like kings off of plunder and the labor of their slaves and subjugated vassals. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Since then, orcs have been gradually been relegated second-class citizens. Their physical prowess saw them exploited as a source of cheap labor, or conscripted as shock troops by nations that were willing to field them. As the world became industrialized, many were drawn to large cities for the plentiful jobs in foundries and factories. Others were drawn by the opportunity for criminal enterprise: many cities now have problems with orc gangs, and there are places where orc criminal rings have seized control of gambling, smuggling, and drug trades. Many orcs still live in poverty&mdash;but a few dedicated or lucky ones have landed a skilled trade and a respected position, and more join them every year.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Orcs are still mistrusted by many.

They superficially resemble humans, but have several key differences which can be used to identify them. The most easily spotted is their teeth, which resemble the teeth of a shark, adapted for eating meat. Ghouls also have limbs which are longer and wirier than humans, which makes them look subtly misshapen, and they tend to be pallid and dark-haired.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Ghouls mature at the same rate as humans. Although they can live on more or less the same diet as humans, ghouls are obligate carnivores: they must have at least some meat in their diet, or suffer from malnutrition. However, a healthy ghoul is extremely difficult to kill: ghouls can recover from almost any injury as long as they have time and a supply of meat; in extreme cases, ghouls can regenerate in the middle of a fight using the flesh torn from their enemies.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Magical Qualities</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Ghouls are somehow connected to the Underworld, and traces of it linger in their bloodlines, giving them a tenuous link to the Underworld. This bond makes ghouls incredibly resilient; experienced ghoul hunters always apply a coup de grace to ensure that a downed ghoul remains down.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">It is believed that ghouls are an artificially created race; they were first encountered just over a hundred years ago, and the first ghouls were found scavenging from graveyards and battlefields in an isolated region to the far south. At the time, most scholars suggested that ghouls were the product of experiments by a single isolated wizard, and were set free or left to fend for themselves. Later, when ghouls were discovered living in the Underworld, a lively debate arose: to this day, it is unknown whether ghouls were created by a wizard and transplanted to the Underworld, arose naturally in the Underworld and were brought into the Material Plane, or somehow managed to arise independently in both worlds at once. The only entities that might know the true answer are some of the older residents of the Underworld.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Many ghouls are uncivilized, no better than feral animals, but possessed of a dangerous cunning. They are generally wary around armed, prepared individuals, but when driven by hunger or confronted with an easy target, ghouls are known to attack in packs and drag still-living victims away for later meals. For this reason, feral ghouls are treated like dangerous animals, and are hunted down at the earliest opportunity.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">However, when raised in civilization, ghouls are perfectly capable of overcoming their instincts. Infant ghouls are sometimes spared by hunters uncomfortable with the implications of killing something that looks generally human, and these ghouls and their descendants are now well-known, if not exactly common, in civilized society. Although no better or worse, on average, than humans or other civilized races, these &ldquo;civic&rdquo; ghouls remain tainted by their feral cousins in the eyes of many. As such, even civic ghouls are frequently forced into messy, bloody jobs in order to meet their specialized dietary requirements: they can commonly be found as hunters, butchers, and slaughterhouse workers. The worst-off sometimes stoop to working in mortuaries and graveyards, which contributes to ghouls&rsquo; unsavory reputation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">A small minority of ghouls are somewhere between civilized and completely feral: whether they learned by watching and mimicking other races, or are the product of a half-successful attempt to raise them in civilization, these ghouls remain dangerously unstable.

Most gnomes have ruddy complexions and vibrant hair colors: chestnut brown, fiery red, or bright yellow. Their eyes are similarly vibrant: bright greens and piercing blues are common. Male gnomes can grow some facial hair (seldom more than a mustache and goatee), and both genders usually let their hair grow wild and spiky.

If a gnome does not wish to be seen, watchers&rsquo; eyes will often pass them over without registering anything. With training, this ability can be honed into a form of invisibility.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Most gnomes live in small, self-sufficient communities in Faerie, and are content to live out humble, peaceful lives. Gnomes fish, hunt, and live off the land rather than farm, and seldom attract attention to themselves&mdash;although anyone who finds a gnomish settlement and enters in peace can count on a warm welcome, full of laughter, music and merrymaking, since gnomes rarely receive visitors. Gnomes have an innate gift for illusion magic, and many of them use it to become unparalleled practical jokesters.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">However, since the Sidhe came to power, many gnomish communities have hidden themselves or moved into the deeper parts of Faerie, as they have learned to expect mistreatment from the Sidhe: when the Sidhe become aware of a gnomish community, they often conscript heavily from it in order to have gnomish spies and illusionists, or they demand tribute in the form of spellwork.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The origin of gnomes is hotly debated in academic circles. Although it might simply be due to their tendency to hide, there is no record of gnomes existing, either on the Material Plane or in Faerie, prior to the Collapse. Various theories suggest that they are descendants of mortal races that crossed into Faerie and became trapped, similar to how the Sidhe were once elves, or how goblins became boggarts after generations trapped in the Underworld. Some of these theories suggest that gnomes are descended from halflings, due to a general physical resemblance. Other, less charitably, suggest that their fondness for hiding comes from goblin ancestry. A third theory, only recently gaining traction and still rejected by elven scholars, is that gnomes were intentionally created from elven stock by the Sidhe after their ascent to power, only to escape and go into hiding. Gnomes themselves have little to say on the subject.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Although most gnomes would prefer to hide from danger, many find themselves forced into action as the Sidhe tighten their control over Faerie. Few actively take up arms, but many gnomish enclaves provide shelter to resistance fighters, serving as safehouses and way-stations. Those gnomes who do join the fight are more likely to do so as saboteurs and spies, but there are a handful who put their invisibility and illusions to work as assassins. For fear of reprisals, most gnomes who join the resistance travel far from home before joining up, so that they cannot be connected back to their family and friends.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Other gnomes flee Faerie entirely, and make new lives in the material world. Gnomish communities have sprung up all over the world&mdash;although fewer than average around Caras Elvaren. While gnomes generally get along well with elves, given their matching affinities for magic and nature, the Sidhe possess more influence in Caras Elvaren than elsewhere, and the looming threat of Faerie agents inspires many gnomes to live further afield. Many gnomish communities are founded near halfling communities: aside from their similar size, gnomes appreciate the pastoral lifestyle of halflings that have settled down.</span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

Their hair has mostly the same range of colors as humans, although it tends to be more vibrant. High elves tend towards blonde or black hair, and wood elves are more commonly brown- or red-haired. A very few elves have hair of strange shades, like blue, green or purple, which is typically a sign of sorcerous ancestry. Both male and female elves let their hair grow long.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Elven children mature slightly slower than humans; they are considered mature (physically and mentally) on their 25<sup>th</sup> birthday. Due to this, elves tend to have a broader education by the time they go out into the world. Once mature, however, their aging slows considerably. Elves do not show signs of old age until they are at least 200 years old; many live to be 350 or older.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Culture and Attitudes</span></u></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">In the aftermath of the Collapse, the elven civilization splintered over their reactions to the catastrophe. The two largest factions came to be known as the High and Wood Elves.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The High Elves wished to continue living much as they had previously. They renounced their former rulers, the Sidhe, who had led them to such ruin, but retained many aspects of the culture that the Sidhe has created: the high elves kept their focus on arcane magic, and when they began to rebuild, they modeled their new nation, Caras Elvaren, on the best parts of their fallen empire, Caras Sidharen. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">High elves value learning and knowledge, especially in the arcane arts. Many high elves dabble in magic, even if their focus lies elsewhere. They also prize arts, music, and theater.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">High elven society is ruled by a council of Houses&mdash;essentially guilds which govern crucial services ranging from providing food and water, to healing the sick and protecting far-flung elven enclaves. Elves who are not part of these guilds are nominally represented by the guild of magisters, ascetic mages who have sworn service to the elven people&mdash;in practice, not all of the guildless are satisfied with this.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">In contrast to the high elves, the wood elves renounced the arcane as the ultimate cause of the Collapse, and withdrew into the deepest forests they could find. There, they lived as hunters and woodsmen. In the first century after the Collapse, this was a bleak existence: they could barely feed their people without using the arcane conveniences that had supported Caras Sidharen. Over time, the wood elves began to use primal magics, forming a bond with the nature spirits which inhabited their forests. These spirits created bountiful, hidden glades and led the elves to plentiful hunting grounds, which provided enough food to bring them back from the brink of starvation. Wood elves tend to learn practical skills due to their humble lifestyles, especially the arts of war; young wood elves are expected to train in archery or swordplay so that they can protect their villages and join in hunting parties. Wood elven art tends to be practical as well; woodcarving and weaving are common trades, although wood elves also have a rich history which is recited in verse by bards. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The wood elves have a reclusive society, nestled in the heart of a primeval forest. In theory, they are ruled by a queen who possesses absolute power, but in practice, the current queen is more interested in hunting and revelry. Actual governance is left to various local lords, as well as various sects of druids, and the way that laws are actually enforced varies widely between regions: some lords are noble and fair, some share the queen&rsquo;s preoccupation with hunting and revelry, and others are wildly xenophobic, preying on any outsider who wouldn&rsquo;t be missed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">High elves tend to be soft-spoken, with impeccable manners. Wood elves are less reserved, at least when they are at home&mdash;but wood elves venturing into the wider world for the first time tend to be somewhat overwhelmed and introverted. Because of this, elves from both cultures have a reputation for aloofness or arrogance&mdash;which is accurate in some cases, but this isn&rsquo;t really the norm.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">There are other elven cultures&mdash;some elves have integrated into human societies, for example. There are also the feysworn elves, who serve the Sidhe in Faerie, and the dark elves, a loose collection of outcasts who seek to conquer or destroy humanity for their role in the Collapse and the destruction of Caras Sidharen. </span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

Dwarves have the same variety of hair and skin colors as humans, although red and blonde hair is somewhat more common among them. They tend not to cut their hair, which is very thick and voluminous, instead working it into complex braids as a symbol of age and wisdom&mdash;the longer a dwarf&rsquo;s braids, the longer they have lived and the greater the respect they are given. Male dwarves can grow enormously bushy beards, but many choose to shave or keep it trimmed, especially if they work with complex machinery that might snag on facial hair.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Although dwarf children mature at the same rate as humans, dwarves are slow to feel the effects of old age, remaining hale and hearty well into their second century.

The traditionists hold on desperately to the remnants of their culture from before the Collapse. They venerate their ancestors, and carefully preserve their knowledge and creations, causing them to be distrustful of technological progress. In addition to the pantheon worshipped by other races, the dwarves follow a form of ancestor worship overseen by a group of historian-priests called the Stonekeepers. The Stonekeepers keep records of a dwarf&rsquo;s accomplishments and deeds, and when a dwarf dies, his clan&rsquo;s Stonekeeper will evaluate what he did with his life to determine if he deserves to become one of the honored dead, immortalized in stone.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">While the dwarves were once the undisputed masters of stonecraft and metalworking, human industry has begun to compete with them. While dwarf artisans are still immensely skilled, the techniques developed by the ancient dwarves remain mostly unimproved-upon, while humans have developed new industrial methods. A person seeking an heirloom-quality weapon that his grandchildren will be proud to use would still do well to seek out a dwarf smith&mdash;but to equip an entire army, people now depend on human foundries, who can produce decent-quality goods quickly and cheaply.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Modernist dwarves have broken with the ancient ways of doing things and started adopting human inventions and improving them with dwarven skill and craftsmanship. Notably, the reloading mechanisms used in military-grade crossbows and firearms were developed by dwarves working for human arms manufacturers. The modernists remain a minority among dwarves, largely due to the Stonefathers&rsquo; condemnation. Many modernists are apprentice artisans, barely past their fourth decade, who have found themselves out of work as business increasingly goes to the humans instead of the master-smiths they work for. As a result, there is a growing expatriate dwarven presence in human cities, where they can find gainful employment&mdash;since even a dwarf apprentice is the equivalent of a skilled laborer among humans.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Both dwarven cultures place heavy emphasis on family relationships and form tight-knit extended family groups known as clans. Most dwarven businesses are owned by clans, rather than individuals, and most clans specialize in a handful of trades, training their children to follow in the family business. Young dwarves with talents that don&rsquo;t line up with their clan are often traded or sold to more fitting clans, although these days, the money is usually given to the young dwarf in question as a parting gift.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: 0.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Dwarves in general appreciate a good day&rsquo;s work, followed by a stiff drink. They form close friendships, especially when they&rsquo;ve been separated from their clan for a while, and are fiercely loyal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>"},"flags":[],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}
