Artificers are magical craftsmen, responsible for inventing and building many of the magical conveniences that make modern life possible, but their talents can also be used to create and enhance magical arms and armor. They can also cast spells like any arcanist; like wizards, their magic runs on just the power available to normal mortals, but instead of using spells that are refined to the highest possible efficiency, artificers construct tools, talismans, and devices that automate and optimize the most complex parts of their spells.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Artificers usually go into combat festooned with trinkets and gadgets, each one serving a specific purpose. None of these are technically magical items, but they serve as conduits and focusing devices for the artificer&rsquo;s own power. In a way, they are analogous to the carefully designed and optimized spells of a wizard&mdash;they are simply physical devices, rather than mnemonic devices.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Also, since many artificers work with magical armor and weapons, they inevitably develop some familiarity with armed combat; many wear heavier armor than other arcanists, and some prefer to fight with weapons while reserving their magic to enhance their arms and armor.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Artificers often start out as mundane craftsmen&mdash;blacksmiths, armorers, or steamworkers&mdash;who then begin to dabble in magic. Their previous career, giving them a predilection towards physical objects, is often what draws them to artifice instead of wizardry. Other individuals are drawn to artifice from the very beginning; in recent years, as artifice has become more prominent and widespread, schools of wizardry have seen a drop in enrollment as potential students turn towards the more technical field of artifice. Still other artificers formerly aspired towards other types of magic, but switched to artifice when they found it easier to grasp; in the early years of artifice, many hedge wizards who had struggled with traditional wizardry became competent artificers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Learning artifice is a process of developing tools; at first, students are taught to work magic using a standardized set of focuses and devices. As they gain skill, apprentice artificers begin to construct their own, personalized tools, at the same time that they begin to work on magical items. A fully-qualified artificer carries a set of custom devices, often constructing a specific device for each spell.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Artifice developed as an offshoot of wizardry during the industrial revolution following the Collapse of the first age of civilization. As more and more arcanists started to specialize in creating magical items or incorporating magic into machinery, it was inevitable that some of them would start to use physical devices in their own spellcasting. Eventually, a specialist discipline arose, in which these focuses were the core of the practitioner&rsquo;s magic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Artificers are in high demand, as the craftsmen and engineers who support a society dependent on magical conveniences. Many artificers spend their days doing nothing but constructing or repairing everyday magical devices; others produce and maintain magical equipment for militaries or police forces. Some are involved in larger-scale applications such as the design of airship cores, cognition engines, or city-scale defenses. And a few, interested more in expanding the boundaries of knowledge than in applications, construct and operate equipment for high-energy metaphysics projects.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 18.0pt;\">Artificer Class Traits</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Hit Points: 26 + Constitution score</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Resurgences: 3 + &lt;CON&gt;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Class Defense Bonus: +2 to Will</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, chain, light shields</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Weapon Proficiencies: Simple and military melee, simple and military ranged</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Implement Proficiencies: Scepter, staff, wand</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Skills: Arcana, plus four more from the following list, and one other:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in;\">Arcana (Int), Endurance (Con), Engineering (Int), Medicine (Int), Nature (Int), Perception (Wis), Religion (Int), Subterfuge (Dex), Warfare (Int)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Healing Ward</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>You can create protective fields around your allies, which deflect attacks and absorb the brunt of impacts.

A creature can only activate one gadget per round, and only one of your gadgets can be activated per round&mdash;if one of your allies tries to activate a second of your gadgets, it has no effect.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\">A gadget containing a lesser power can be used any number of times, but a gadget containing a greater power can only be used once.

The base type of item must remain the same: a magical longsword can only be turned into a different kind of magical longsword and magical chainmail can only be turned into a different kind of magical chainmail, for example. A tinkered item keeps its original monetary value, even if its new enchantment would normally be worth less.

Unlike the sorcerers that came before them, they use only the magical power available to a normal mortal. They make up for this limitation through painstaking study and extensive practice; not only do wizards know a vast variety of spells, but their spells are also far more efficient than other spellcasters&rsquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">In all their time studying, wizards learn and develop a large number of spells, many of which fall by the wayside. But a wizard only needs to consult his spellbooks in order to recall and prepare one of his older spells. This makes wizards very versatile; when they have time to prepare for an upcoming conflict, they can often find a relevant spell somewhere in their library.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">Wizards are also extremely power-efficient spellcasters; due to their limited reserves of power, they take pains to optimize their spells as far as possible; their spells are thus far harder to shake off than those of other casters.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">Most wizards learn their art through a school or apprenticeship, although there are cases of prodigies who developed their magic independently by studying secondhand spellbooks or fragments of forgotten lore. Many villages also have a &ldquo;hedge wizard&rdquo; or two; would-be arcanists who never progressed past the basics of wizardry. They might not be able to call lightning or breathe fire, but they often recognize youngsters with the talent and interest to become wizards, and teach them the basics before sending them off to learn more from a fully-qualified wizard.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">The difficulty in learning wizardry lies in its complexity; a sorcerer or warlock can just dump power into a spell in order to make it work, an artificer has his trinkets and Gadgets, but a wizard has to make do with pure mental discipline. A wizard&rsquo;s spells are orders of magnitude more complex than equivalent spells designed by another arcanist; they rely on intricate interactions and highly efficient methods to achieve their effects, and the ability to understand these is what separates a hedge magician from a full-fledged, certified wizard.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">Wizardry was originally developed by a cabal of scholarly elven sorcerers. While investigating the causes and origins of sorcery, they attempted to teach a group of commoner elves to use sorcery. Although they didn&rsquo;t succeed in unlocking sorcerous potential in their test group, they did discover that, contrary to common belief, all mortals had a degree of magical power, even if it was miniscule compared to what a sorcerer held. When it became apparent that their subjects would not have the power to throw a fireball like the sorcerers they attempted to emulate, the experiment was abandoned, but now that the test subjects had a taste for magic, they continued to practice and teach their art, which they named wizardry, in secret.

Wizards and artificers must grow in power through study and practice, and of course warlocks tap into the power of an otherworldly patron&hellip;but a few people have far greater reserves of power from the very start&mdash;sorcerers. Even a raw, untrained sorcerer has enough magical potential to make an archmage envious.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">This power does not come without cost, however. Where it is often a struggle for a wizard to call forth the power for their spells, a sorcerer struggles to hold their magic back. Every time a sorcerer casts a spell, a little bit of magic spills out, forming a dangerous nimbus around them. In addition to being an eye-catching display, this nimbus provides protection to the sorcerer, and can be focused upon creatures that let their guards down around the sorcerer. In combat, sorcerers are highly visible, very threatening opponents; because they tend to attract attention, many sorcerers choose to use this to their advantage, specializing in close-range spells and training to use weapons so as to better survive while drawing attention away from their allies.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">Although the precise causes behind the sorcerous gift are unknown, it is apparent that one contributing factor is prenatal exposure to magic. Children whose mothers were themselves spellcasters, or worked around high concentrations of magic, have a much higher chance of manifesting a sorcerous gift at some point during their lives. Some families with a high incidence of sorcery claim that the gift ultimately stems from an unusual ancestor such as a dragon, fey, or angel, but many consider these claims to be grandiose posturing.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">A sorcerer&rsquo;s powers typically first manifest under conditions of extreme emotion or stress. It can happen at any age&mdash;there are records of sorcerers manifesting while still in the cradle, and on their deathbed&mdash;but about half of all sorcerers manifest during adolescence. Sorcerers can improve their skills with practice, but they seldom achieve the fine control of wizards or the technical expertise of artificers, and the sorcerous gift is capricious and changeable. Sorcerers&rsquo; spells tend to evolve and change quickly; it is only a slight exaggeration to say that a sorcerer can go to bed with entirely different spells than he woke up with.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">Sorcerers were the first mortal magic-users, originating among the elven tribes before the founding of Caras Elvaren. Over the centuries, the gift spread as more and more children were exposed to magic, but sorcery only ever gained widespread acceptance among the elves. The dwarves abandoned sorcery in favor of wizardry as soon as they learned of the more precise, controllable art, and magic of most kinds was shunned among the human nations before the Collapse. Even the elves eventually moved away from sorcery, granting greater prestige to wizards and the warlocks empowered by their Sidhe patrons. During the Collapse, sorcery was widely regarded as either an elven curse, or the cause of the calamity, and for centuries afterwards sorcerers were persecuted as witches and demon-worshippers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">Even today, sorcerers face a degree of prejudice. They have a reputation (with a grain of truth) for being unpredictable and volatile. Sorcery is also less consistent than wizardry and artifice&mdash;sorcerous spells cannot be reliably taught to other sorcerers&mdash;and so sorcerers have difficulty using their talents in &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; fields like academia and industry. Instead, many sorcerers choose to focus on the destructive aspect of their powers. These sorcerers join the army as battle-mages, or go into organized crime as powerful and feared enforcers. Some tread the middle ground, as private investigators, bodyguards, or mercenaries.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18.0pt;\">Sorcerer Class Traits</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\">Hit Points: 30 + Constitution score</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\">Resurgences: 4 + &lt;CON&gt;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\">Class Defense Bonus: +1 to Fortitude and Will</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\">Armor Proficiencies: Cloth</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\">Weapon Proficiencies: Simple and martial melee, simple and martial ranged</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\">Implements: Scepter, staff, wand</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\">Skills: Arcana, plus four more from the following list, and one other:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: right 3.75in;\">Arcana (Int), Endurance (Con), Intimidate (Cha), Perception (Wis), Religion (Int), Society (Int), Subterfuge (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Warfare (Int)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Nimbus of Power</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 3.75in;\">As a minor action, you can surround yourself with a <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">nimbus</em> of arcane energy which lashes out at your foes, granting you several benefits:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .25in right 3.75in;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">~<span style=\"font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><!--[endif]-->Whenever a creature you have challenged makes an attack that does not target you while within 5 squares of you, it takes 1d8 damage.

Rather than increase their power with long study and practice, however, warlocks use their meager magic to beg, borrow, or steal greater power from otherworldly beings&mdash;or, if they have no other option, they swear themselves to the service of such eldritch creatures. Most warlocks constantly seek greater power&mdash;for eventually, their patron will come to collect on the debt.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">Many of the people who become warlocks do so out of desperation, impatience, or resentment towards the arcane establishment. Their magic tends to involve deadly hexes, and warlocks often prefer to work from the shadows.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">A warlock&rsquo;s hex is a deadly affliction, which is almost as varied as warlocks themselves. The common element of hexes is that they empower the warlock&rsquo;s spells against a hexed creature, but hexes can be adapted to apply a variety of other debilitating conditions.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">Many warlocks start out as average people and gain their power as part of a desperate bargain: in a situation with seemingly no way out, an eldritch being presents them with an option that has a seemingly acceptable cost. Sometimes this is actually the case, and the patron is benevolent or at least reasonable. In other cases, the patron is a predator&mdash;a demon intent on taking a soul, or an abomination from beyond the stars whose power slowly erodes the wielder&rsquo;s sanity. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">Other warlocks actively seek out this route to power, following instructions from other warlocks or clues found in dusty tomes. Many who take this path are hedge wizards or defrocked clergy, desperate for power and recognition that they cannot get any other way. These warlocks can gain their power by trapping a potential patron and offering to release it in exchange for the power they seek. Even if this goes as planned, a warlock who extorts their power from their patron must always look over their shoulder, as their victim tries to terminate its agreement. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">The first warlocks arose after the first elven lords crossed into Faerie and became the Sidhe. The Sidhe were immensely powerful within Faerie, but due to their altered nature, they found themselves unable to leave and exert any influence upon the mortal world. To get around this, they empowered their loyal retainers, creating the first warlocks to act as their agents. Soon, this magical pact became one of the main rewards for service to a Sidhe lord.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">Over the years, would-be arcanists found other beings willing to enter into a warlock&rsquo;s pact: elementals, gravelords, demons, and enigmatic beings from distant stars. Many of these newer patrons proved less benevolent than the Sidhe lords, however, and tales of the disasters that befell unlucky or incautious warlocks ensured that pact magic became distrusted and shunned in most societies. After the Collapse and the loss of Caras Seidharen, even the Sidhe lords became distrusted among many elves.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 18.0pt;\">Warlocks continue to be outcasts, both for the route to power that they take, and the fates that befall them and those around them. As with sorcerers, warlocks&rsquo; magic is hard to teach or replicate, and they find themselves barred from mainstream magical employment. Many ambitious warlocks use their powers to establish a reputation and a following&mdash;even a cult&mdash;in areas beyond the reach of civilization; others become hermits who spend their lives hoarding power and fending off their supernatural creditors. Those who do not turn away from society commonly find employment as mercenaries, assassins or enforcers for the criminal underground. Many warlocks would jump at the chance to join the military, but are turned away because of their conflicted loyalties. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 18.0pt;\">Warlock Class Traits</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Hit Points: 22 + Constitution score</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Resurgences: 3 + &lt;CON&gt;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Class Defense Bonus: +1 to Reflex and Will</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee and ranged</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Implements: Scepter, staff, wand</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Skills: Arcana, plus four more from the following list, and one other:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in;\">Arcana (Int), Deception (Cha), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Persuasion (Cha),</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in;\">Religion (Int), Society (Int), Stealth (Dex), Subterfuge (Dex)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Dark Bargain</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once per encounter as a free action, you can sacrifice a resurgence to bargain with your patron for a special boon.

Clad in plate armor, they strike out with swords and mailed fists, or channel the very presence of their deity to inspire awe and fear in their foes. A paladin is at their best when facing a foe in single combat, where they can focus all of their holy displeasure on that one foe.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Paladins are often trained as squires to older, more experienced paladins: they learn to fight and care for their arms and armor in between lessons on theology and liturgy. Others are soldiers who developed a religious calling, or are trained as the soldiers of particularly militaristic faiths before being initiated as a paladin.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Many paladins act as traditional knights-errant, wandering the world in search of wrongs to right and evils to oppose. Others settle down to protect a particular temple or town. Some are soldiers for their temple, sent to protect the faithful when they come under threat, or detached to assist armies fighting in wars that align with the interests of the faith.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 18.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 18.0pt;\">Paladin Class Features</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, chain, scale, plate, light and heavy shields</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Weapon Proficiencies: Simple and military melee, simple ranged</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Implement Proficiencies: Holy symbol</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Class Defense Bonus: +1 to Fortitude and Will</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Hit Points: 30 + Constitution score</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Resurgences: 4 + &lt;CON&gt;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Primary Skills: Religion, plus four more from the following list, and one other:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in;\">Athletics (Str), Endurance (Con), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Medicine (Int), Perception (Wis), Persuasion (Cha), Religion (Int), Warfare (Int)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Divine Challenge</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You have the <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">divine challenge</em> class feature power, which can be used to challenge enemies.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Divine Sanction</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once per round when a creature challenged by you makes an attack which does not include you as a target, you may deal 1d8 + &lt;WIS&gt; radiant damage to it.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Miracle: Inviolacy</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can learn and use miracles, which are exceptionally potent greater powers.

Others are self-taught, having developed a connection to their deity from reading holy texts or listening to travelling preachers. Still others experience revelations&mdash;dreams or hallucinations that inspire religious awe and a sense of purpose.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Of all the divine classes, clerics have the most in common with simple priests: many can be found attached to temples, where they tend the sick and injured, as well as seeing to the spiritual needs of the congregation. Others, of a more proactive mindset, enlist or attach themselves to armies, offering guidance to soldiers or even fighting alongside them. Still others set off on their own, working in slums and prisons to bring comfort to the downtrodden.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 18.0pt;\">Cleric Class Features</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Armor Proficiencies: Cloth, leather, chain, light shields</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Weapon Proficiencies: Simple melee, simple ranged</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Implement Proficiencies: Holy symbol</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Hit Points: 22 + Constitution score</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Resurgences: 3 + &lt;CON&gt;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">Class Defense Bonus: +2 to Will</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in; text-indent: -.25in;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Skills: Religion, plus four more from the following list, and one other:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left: .25in;\">Arcana (Int), Engineering (Int), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Medicine (Int), Nature (Int), Perception (Wis), Persuasion (Cha), Religion (Int)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Faith Healing</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When you use a divine healing power which allows a single creature to use a resurgence, they regain &lt;WIS&gt; additional hit points.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Miracle: Lay on Hands</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can learn and use miracles, which are exceptionally potent greater powers.
