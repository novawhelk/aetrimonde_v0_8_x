It fell before they did, however, falling apart under the weight of a rigid caste system, inbreeding among the aristocracy, and a well-timed slave uprising. The territory Gobol Karn once occupied—now part of the Unclaimed Reaches—is now home to debased goblin tribes, not even a shadow of their former glory, but the ruins still hold valuable secrets. The ancient goblins worked wonders with alchemy, and every few years an expedition brings back some rediscovered formula, or strange creatures escaped from the laboratories of Gobol Karn’s alchemical breeders.

Tribal orcs are widely feared by outsiders, having been the cause of the Collapse, and nobody wants to see those events repeated—least of all the orcs themselves. Far from the bloodthirsty savages of legend, the orcs of Urku purposefully isolate themselves from outsiders in an effort to avoid a repeat of the Collapse, which killed most of a generation of young orcs. Their borderlands are inhabited by outcasts: orcs unable or unwilling to be anything but a blood-soaked monster. These violent savages serve as a deterrent to outsiders, but past them, the shamanic orcs of Urku practice rigid self-control, venting their fury only in ritualized, nonlethal duels or by hunting dangerous beasts. </span></span></p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":2,"hsFJxrWN4M5Ezw3L":3,"lh2XdhvmO8rwUMvb":2},"flags":{},"_id":"2i2UlFIy3OM2mRc5"}

It began as an attempt to reform ancient elven society, keeping its general form while eliminating the rot which allowed the Sidhe to become tyrants. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">History</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Not all of the elves who lived through the Collapse chose to fade into obscurity in Tir Coetir. The remainder, many of whom were dissenters even before the Collapse, resolved to rebuild their civilization in the west, avoiding the failures of their former rulers.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Their new nation was named Caras Elvaren: loosely translated, &ldquo;A Nation for the People.&rdquo; Its society and government were built deliberately to deny the possibility of tyrants, particularly tyrants of a magical nature: the country has no central authority, and many provisions allowing the people to make their voices heard or restrain those in power.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">This was accompanied by a massive cultural shift: the high elves, as they came to be called, shunned sorcery and pacts with eldritch beings, which were common and prestigious forms of magic under the Sidhe. Instead, they turned to wizardry since&mdash;in theory&mdash;anyone could become a wizard with sufficient study. They were aided in this paradigm shift by Talsien, the legendary first wizard, who had been banished centuries earlier by the Sidhe. Talsien visited the high elves many times during the first few centuries of their new government (somehow not seeming to age during his absences), each time providing the elves with some new insight into magic. Talsien&rsquo;s final visit occurred four centuries after the founding of Caras Elvaren, during which he gave his staff, wand, cloak, and spellbook to four of his apprentices&mdash;themselves wizards of great power&mdash;charging them with the preservation of Caras Elvaren from authoritarian rule.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">All of these anti-authoritarian measures succeeded, perhaps too well: the elves of Caras Elvaren have maintained a position of neutrality in foreign affairs for most of the last millennium, largely due to their government&rsquo;s difficulty in reaching a consensus on foreign policy. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">On the few occasions when the high elves have engaged in diplomacy for more than routine trade agreements and affirmations of friendship, it has been to counsel against war and authoritarianism. Most notably, Caras Elvaren broke their policy of neutrality several times during the Wars of Smoke and Steel, threatening to ally with the losing sides in several wars, so that the wars would come to an end. The high elves were also the driving force behind the peace treaties which finally ended the Wars, and the establishment of the Concilium in an effort to prevent similarly destructive wars in the future. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Politics</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The government of Caras Elvaren is difficult to define, because there is so little of it: the nation was once described as &ldquo;the closest one can get to anarchy, while still having something that resembles a government.&rdquo; Outside observers largely concur that Caras Elvaren is a federation of free-associating anarcho-syndicalist cooperatives, although this holds little meaning for anyone who does not study politics.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The core of Caras Elvaren&rsquo;s government is the House, a formal association of citizens working toward a common purpose. The Houses originated as the households of aristocratic elves who escaped the Collapse, and were rapidly reformed to allow any group of citizens to form their own House. A House is permitted to claim a limited form of sovereignty over land which they own outright, and to send a representative to the National Assembly: in exchange, the House is required to perform services &ldquo;suited to the skills of its members, and contributing to the common good&rdquo; as determined by the National Assembly every ten years. Houses with many farmers may be required to provide food to the un-Housed, Houses that trade may be required to maintain roads or canals, and Houses with many wizards and artificers may be required to maintain the nation&rsquo;s many magic-dependent public conveniences.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Houses commonly rise and fall within Caras Elvaren: those which succeed at their appointed functions are rewarded with prestige, as well as funding to take on more complicated or important functions. Those which fail due to negligence or incompetence are assessed fines and penalties, which can often drive members of a House to abandon it, leading to its disbanding. It is rare for a House to remain large and powerful for long: the anarchic leanings of the elves often cause powerful Houses to be saddled with increasingly onerous duties, until they eventually fail to meet their obligations and begin to decline. This creates turnover in the upper ranks of the Houses, preventing the rise of a permanent ruling class and allowing new factions opportunities to grow.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">A notable exception to this is the small number of military Houses which make up Caras Elvaren&rsquo;s professional military: though they are essential to preserving the nation&rsquo;s neutral stance, other Houses remain painfully aware that the standing army is one of a few remaining avenues for a would-be tyrant to take charge. The National Assembly therefore strikes a delicate balance when it comes to the military Houses: they are provided with a generous budget and given a prominent voice when it comes to matters of national defense&mdash;in exchange for staying out of politics.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Society</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">In addition to performing the role of government, the Houses are also the center of society in Caras Elvaren. Some citizens join a House because it advocates for their causes in the Assembly. Others join a House because it offers work to people of their skills, or because the House&rsquo;s reputation and connections open doors to them.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Most Houses are run on a vaguely democratic basis: since a House&rsquo;s political power depends heavily on maintaining its membership, dictatorial Houses don&rsquo;t tend to last long. Some Houses are simply comprised of an extended family, and are run by the family elders; others have aristocratic traditions in which the heirs of the founding members have a disproportionate say in the running of the House. Regardless of the exact organization, it is difficult for any House to maintain its membership if its leaders consistently make unpopular decisions. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">At any time, roughly two-thirds of citizens belong to a House, with many of the others being temporarily between Houses. However, there is a sizeable underclass of permanently un-Housed citizens: these are largely unskilled workers (by elven standards) who have nothing to contribute to a House, or those who are so exceptionally anti-authority that they decline to participate in the House system.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Because Houses claim sovereignty over their land, many disagreements and crimes are handled internally, or by mutual agreement between the Houses of criminal and victim. If no agreement can be reached, there are also neutral Houses which act as mediators due to the prevalence of legal theorists in their membership. On the rare occasion when even this does not resolve a dispute, the aggrieved Houses can seek a judgement from the National Assembly, but this is unusual, as it exposes both Houses&rsquo; private business to public view. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Some Houses claim territory outside of the borders of Caras Elvaren, ranging from ancient elven outposts and important ley-line conjunctions to simple shops and theaters in foreign countries. Their legal status can be complicated&mdash;as it is not always clear how a House&rsquo;s sovereignty interacts with a host nation&rsquo;s laws&mdash;but their host nations generally take a hands-off approach, treating these House enclaves as unofficial embassies or consulates.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">One especially notable House is the Academy of the Evanescent, Caras Elvaren&rsquo;s oldest and most prominent school of wizardry. Founded by Talsien, the legendary original wizard, the Academy accepts students from any House and no House, on the sole condition that they transfer their House membership to the Academy for the duration of their education. This is one of the factors responsible for the remarkable stability of Caras Elvaren&rsquo;s society and traditions: the Grand Masters of the Academy descend in an unbroken chain of apprenticeships from Talsien himself, and view it as their sworn duty to perpetuate the society that their forebear helped to build. Students at the Academy are inculcated with the traditional elven virtues: diligence, selflessness, and the endless search for inward perfection. As many of these students eventually return to prominent positions in their Houses of origin, or go on to found their own, the Academy quietly ensures the continuity of elven philosophy in the halls of power.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Because of the Academy and other schools of magic, Caras Elvaren possesses vastly more arcanists in the population than any other nation. As a result, the entire nation is steeped in magic. A breakthrough two centuries ago led to the construction of ley line taps&mdash;vast mechanisms capable of drawing and harnessing power from the ley lines running beneath the earth. The taps generate a magical field around them, capable of powering all manner of magical devices from automated farm equipment to labor golems&mdash;and the taps are everywhere. Very few elves perform manual labor or get their hands dirty in the traditional sense: the &ldquo;working class&rdquo; in Caras Elvaren now consists of technicians who know how to maintain and direct these magical tools. The elves are loath to share the plans or theories behind the ley-line taps, partly because of the advantage it gives them&mdash;but also because the devices can be horrendously destructive if miscalibrated. The taps are Caras Elvaren&rsquo;s strength and weakness at the same time, for they are what grant the elves their power&mdash;but each one is also a bomb waiting to go off.</span></span></p>","img":"","_id":"4Lb1niy223K3b4XJ"}

Yet, there was one civilization which rose above all others: that of Arcis Aurum, the Golden Citadel.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Arcis Aurum eventually fell, during the Collapse, but at its height it was said that one could walk down any road and eventually reach the Golden Citadel, that the monumental buildings were faced with gold, and that its kings were fair and wise, concerned above all else with the good of their people.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The truth is probably less fanciful, but Legate Gaius Julius Valerius, the general of a Legion which rode out the Collapse in a remote mountainous outpost, drew upon the legends when he set out to reclaim the ruins of humanity&rsquo;s glorious civilization. During his lifetime, his fledgling empire grew from a fortified mining town to encompass dozens of towns and nearly a million souls. He accomplished this by forcibly annexing every population center within a hundred miles, conscripting every able-bodied human into his Legion, and enslaving most of the non-humans to toil in the fields and mines. It was a campaign of ruthless, imperialistic expansion, but by the time of his death, Emperor Gaius had laid the groundwork for a stable, prosperous state amid the ruins of civilization. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Gaius&rsquo; son and grandson, Gaius II and Gaius III (for none of the Valerian Emperors were especially original thinkers) built on this foundation: Gaius II exterminated or enslaved the last of the orcs near the territories of the Novan Imperium, and Gaius III continued to expand the borders until they neared the ruins of Arcis Aurum itself. However, Gaius III&rsquo;s inevitable attempt to retake the heavily orc-infested ruins put an end to the expansionary plans of the Gaian emperors.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">After the first attempt to claim the city failed, causing the near-destruction of two Legions, Gaius III declared his intent to reinstitute universal conscription, a practice which had stopped in his father&rsquo;s reign. The citizens of the Novan Imperium had grown prosperous and complacent, however, and the return of conscription sparked rebellions in several important cities. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">After the enraged Gaius III marched his Legions upon the nearest rebelling city and burned it to the ground, his officers mutinied and assassinated him. Afterwards, the governor of the Arcis Novis, the Imperial capitol, was placed on the throne thanks to a document in which Gaius III had adopted the governor as his heir. The document was likely a forgery, but in the aftermath of the recent rebellions, mutiny, and regicide, few people bothered to question it. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Similar events played out after two more attempts to recapture Arcis Aurum during the next three centuries: each time, elements of the Imperial government conspired to replace the fixated Emperor, until, after the final failed attempt, the newly-crowned Empress Juliana Augusta Antonia decreed that the ruins of Arcis Aurum be left as they were, &ldquo;as a memorial to humanity&rsquo;s ancient glory.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Empress Juliana also formally established the structure of the permanent Novan civil service, instituting a regimen of policies, procedures, offices, and qualifying examinations designed to ensure that the Empire was run by the best minds possible. Additionally, Juliana ceded some of her absolute authority to the newly-created bureaucracy, allowing them to perform day-to-day administrative functions without her input. Perhaps not coincidentally, many of the high-ranking administrators in her new civil service had supported her rise to the throne.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">With its expansionary tendencies quelled, the Novan Imperium turned its attentions inward: the nation prospered as scholars rediscovered lost knowledge of engineering, medicine, and magic, and then moved beyond it into new areas of discovery. The Novans gradually abolished the practice of slavery and began to grant citizenship to non-humans, eventually gaining a large population of loyal orc and dwarf citizens.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The Novan Imperium began the known world&rsquo;s industrial revolution with the invention of the steam engine&mdash;a device invented by exiled dwarves using Novan funding&mdash;and continued to develop mechanical technology. Today, the Novan Imperium is at the forefront of industrial and mechanical engineering, and its engineers and arcanists have begun to experiment with machinery powered by &ldquo;harnessed lightning.&rdquo; The most prominent of these experiments has been the creation of the telectrograph, a device for passing messages over great distances using carefully-modulated bolts of lightning: relays of telectrograph towers now connect the world&rsquo;s great capitals, and are expanding into less populated regions as well.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Politics</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The Novan Imperium is sometimes described as an autocracy, sometimes as a meritocracy, and sometimes as a senatorial republic. In truth, it is all of these, but it is best described as a bureaucracy.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">In theory, the Emperor (or Imperator) is an absolute dictator, but he relies upon a massive and unwieldy civil service to enforce his edicts. It is slow to implement any but the most urgent or universally acclaimed decrees, and over time, the Emperors and Empresses have gradually ceded much of their authority to various offices and bureaus, since they would likely do whatever they pleased anyway. Although in theory the Emperors may appoint any successor they like from among their family, for the last two centuries they have abided by selections made by a council of high-ranking administrators.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The civil service has a strong meritocratic tradition: any citizen of the Imperium who performs a job which is useful to society, and does it well, may find themselves promoted into a position of responsibility. Usually, this works out well: knowledgeable farmers end up on councils which set agricultural subsidies, miners wind up overseeing safety inspections, and so on. However, this makes the Novan government slow to implement &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; changes: many artists, craftsmen and engineers appointed to positions of responsibility fall back to what they know, neglecting new innovations. Styles of art, architecture, and even the Novan language have stagnated as a result.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">There is also a great degree of de-facto nepotism among the bureaucracy: although there are rigorous entrance examinations for the higher ranks of the civil service, many bureaucrats groom their children to follow them into the civil service, enrolling them in prestigious academies and offering insider knowledge to help them pass the exams. Many smaller offices, that attract less competition and fewer inspections, have been held by a single family for generations.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The only branch of the Imperial government which does not suffer from this bureaucratic inertia is the military: the Novan Legions remain under the direct control of the Emperor, and they are often employed as a means to cut through red tape: the legion&rsquo;s engineers, quartermasters, and clerks can be tapped to do double-duty as civilian administrators when the bureaucrats of a particular province are being especially obstructive, and previous Emperors have even sent Legions to forcibly remove governors and their staffs from office.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Emperor Marcus Gaius Antonius is a young Emperor, less than a decade into office.

The farmers are most fortunate, for life is far easier in the countryside than in the crowded, soot-choked cities. Urban plebes are kept satisfied by free food and public entertainment, such as spectacles in the amphitheater: these once featured frequent gladiatorial games, before the abolition of slavery, and there are still occasional death matches between theoretically-consenting combatants.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Fabricians are the inventors, engineers, and captains of industry who direct the Novan economy. It is they who design, develop and market new processes and technologies: the class structure was less defined when the first steam engine was built, but its creators would today be counted as fabricians. The fabricians are also responsible for advances such as the telectrograph&mdash;a means of sending messages great distances on bolts of lightning&mdash;and the railway.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Cognoscenti are the learned&mdash;some would say idle&mdash;class of Novan society. Many are artists, for the demand for bread and circuses means that there is always funding for an artist who can mimic the politically-approved styles. Others are intellectuals, including many arcanists who prefer to spend their efforts on theoretical research: those who put their magic to productive use are usually counted among the Fabricians.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Religion is less common in the Imperium than in the other major powers: the Imperium struggles with a variety of cults&mdash;a legacy of the chaos and despair felt in Arcis Aurum during the Collapse&mdash;and more recently, suffered through a period of religious turmoil during the rise of the Sanctean Primarchy. As a result, many Novans hold a distrust of organized religion, if not religion in general. Priests who engage in politics or are too eager to show off divine magic often find themselves shunned, or even subjected to investigation by the secular authorities.</span></span></p>","_id":"554z6SUV15AGVUG1"}

The city is, by a wide margin, the largest in the known world, but the rest of the country contains no settlement larger than a mid-sized town. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Waystone is small, compared to the other Great Powers, but maintains a position among them by virtue of its vast mercantile network, diplomatic ties to many smaller nations, and highly competent spies and special forces.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">History</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Long before the founding of Waystone, the territory it now occupies was home to many bands of nomadic halflings, who travelled its rolling hills and gentle rivers in caravans and on riverboats. Sadly, the growing power of Gobol Karn, to the south, saw the end of this way of life: as slaver raids became more frequent, almost all halflings fled to the north or found remote valleys in which to hide.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">This state of affairs persisted for centuries, until the decline of Gobol Karn 80 years before the general collapse of civilization at the end of the Age of Tyrants. Following the collapse, as human, elf and dwarf refugees fled west in advance of the oncoming orc horde, they encountered halflings just returning to their ancestral lands. The two groups of settlers, after some initial distrust, agreed to cooperate in securing the lands around what is now called the Lake of the Signing. Some years later, the leaders of the now-prospering refugees signed the First Charter on a great, ancient standing stone at the edge of the lake, and Heomund Lynton became the first King of Waystone by popular acclaim.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">In the eight centuries since, the Kings and Queens of Waystone have turned their nation into an economic powerhouse by exploiting the many rivers feeding into and out of the Lake of the Signing, and later by constructing canals crossing much of the western part of the continent. Vast quantities of freight move through this network and on Waystone&rsquo;s merchant fleet, and the Crown takes its share of taxes on every ounce of it.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">At the beginning of the Wars of Smoke and Steel, nearly a century ago, the Victovan Empire began to expand southward, annexing its smaller neighbors. As the richest nation in their path, it was only a matter of time before the Victs turned their sights on Waystone.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">To survive in the face of Victovan aggression, Waystone used two strategies: first, Waystone built a phenomenally effective intelligence network using its mercantile and political connections across the continent. Using this network, Waystone was able to funnel information, money, and materiel to the targets of Victovan imperialism. This only slowed the Victovan advance, but it bought time for Waystone to build up its forces and develop strategies using newly-developed magics.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">When the Victovan Empire finally declared war, they saw the products of these investments. The Royal Marines, using teleportation circles planted by Waystone&rsquo;s spy networks, struck far behind enemy lines, destroying crucial Victovan factories, supply depots, and garrisons within days of the outbreak of hostilities. As the war dragged on, Waystone continued to support resistance groups in Victovy&rsquo;s occupied territory, providing them with the same equipment and training used by the Marines to such great effect. Eventually, faced with a spreading insurgency, and an enemy that they could not engage in decisive battles, Victovy accepted a ceasefire and abandoned many of its occupied territories.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Waystone continues to ally with minor nations, offering access to its mercantile contacts, intelligence networks, and even military training, in exchange for mutual-defense pacts. There are dozens of these minor allies scattered around the known world&mdash;some of them no larger than city-states&mdash;but thanks to Waystone&rsquo;s mastery of teleportation magic, each one of them is capable of coming to aid the others almost immediately, and most of them have armies trained almost to the standard of the Royal Marines. In this way, Waystone is counted among the other great powers despite their smaller size. Much like the wood elves of Tir Coetir, they have arranged matters so that any attempt to conquer them would result in a pyrrhic victory at best&mdash;and though their treaties technically only provide for mutual defense, there is little doubt that if Waystone decided to go to war, most of the Protectorates would follow. </span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Politics</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Waystone is a constitutional monarchy, with the powers of the monarch tempered by the laws set down in the Charter of Waystone.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The Charter has been amended repeatedly since it was originally written, including two major revisions: Waystone&rsquo;s history is divided into eras between these revisions, and the three eras are referred to as the First, Second, and Third Charters.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The First Charter established a hereditary nobility, and simultaneously placed limits on the powers of these nobles. The Charter also placed a King at the head of the nobility, but placed the selection of the King in the hands of the people: following the signing of the First Charter, Heomund Lynton was elevated to the throne by popular vote, and the remaining nobles became his councilors in the House of Lords.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The Second Charter, amended two centuries after the Founding, granted the power of the Exchequer&mdash;the power to levy taxes and control expenditures&mdash;to the House of Lords so that it might act as a counterweight to the reigning monarch. It also established a House of Commons, which took over the role of councilors to the Crown, but had no official authority. Members of the House of Commons were originally appointed by the House of Lords, resulting in a membership which didn&rsquo;t truly reflect the will of the people.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The Third Charter, written a mere two decades ago, was a reaction to a constitutional crisis provoked by the death of King Edmund and the appointment of a corrupt regent until then-Princess Helena came of age. Regent Blackwood, with support from the House of Lords, removed many checks against the abuse of aristocratic power, leading to the oppression of Waystone&rsquo;s lower and middle classes. After Helena II&rsquo;s ascent to the throne&mdash;having marched on Parliament and overthrown Regent Blackwood at the head of a mob&mdash;the Third Charter granted the House of Commons the legislative powers formerly held by the Crown, and established elections to appoint the members of Parliament.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">In theory, Helena II is now a mere figurehead, having relinquished almost all of the powers of the Crown. However, she holds the loyalty of the common people of Waystone, and her supporters command an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. The only obstacle to her agenda is the House of Lords, which still maintains control over the Treasury.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Waystone&rsquo;s intelligence apparatus&mdash;the Royal Intelligencers, or Queen&rsquo;s Eyes&mdash;is well-funded and frighteningly effective, to the point that Waystone&rsquo;s diplomats no longer bother to pretend that they aren&rsquo;t spying on their allies and rivals. Countless plots and intrigues have been derailed when an ambassador from Waystone showed up unannounced with a folder full of evidence&mdash;and there are an unknown number of plots that succeeded because someone in Waystone decided to lend a helping hand behind the scenes. The Intelligencers are also known to perform assassinations, kidnappings, and other unsavory actions if required&mdash;but they have a code of honor, of sorts, which considers such skullduggery inelegant and ungentlemanly.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Society</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Waystone is essentially two cultures, separated by a deep divide. On one hand, there is the City of Waystone itself, a metropolis unrivaled by any other in the known world, where people of all nations mingle and collaborate. On the other, there are the outlying regions (sometimes called the Environs), home to small farming communities and rural estates.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Life in the capital is vibrant and fast-paced: people are packed closely together, due to a perpetual shortage of land and housing, and it is difficult to go even a single block without hearing at least three languages or dialects. The City&rsquo;s markets overflow with goods from around the world, brought in by Waystone&rsquo;s merchant fleet, and buyers can find anything they might seek&mdash;for the right price. Prosperous merchants in the City buy and sell vast quantities of goods&mdash;often while the goods themselves are still half a world away, thanks to conveniences such as <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">visitation</em> rituals and the telectrogram.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">By contrast, the Environs are laid-back and insular: the economy there revolves around farming&mdash;mostly to feed the millions of mouths in the City, although Waystone still relies heavily on imports from the Protectorates. Waystone&rsquo;s farmers also grow a few other crops, mostly for the textile industry, and many rural farmers are quietly prosperous in their own way. Rural lords and members of Parliament usually spend winters in the City in order to fulfill their governmental duties and attend the obligatory social events, returning to the countryside as soon as the rivers thaw in the spring.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The two cultures of Waystone often profess some derision for each other: the cityfolk view their rural cousins as backwards bumpkins, while the countryfolk consider inhabitants of the City foolish and greedy. Much of this rivalry is tongue-in-cheek: it&rsquo;s quite common for rural youths to move to the City seeking their fortunes, and for City merchants to retire to farms in the country after their ventures pay off. That said, there have been clashes in the past, over issues of taxation, land-use policy, and social programs, where Parliament is thought to favor wealthy City interests.</span></span></p>","_id":"82UZR6UUiq20FU37"}

The throne of the dwarves, in the ruined royal city of Konigstrond, has remained empty for nine centuries, ever since the fall of the High King and the likely extinction of his line during the Collapse: the Regent, elected from among the often-quarrelling thanes of the clans, acts partly as a figurehead, and partly as a scapegoat when things go wrong.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">History</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Prior to the Collapse, when the elves and humans were at each other&rsquo;s&rsquo; throats, the dwarves remained neutral&mdash;even disinterested. They sold weapons to each side, of course, and they appeared in force whenever the fighting strayed too close to their borders, but by and large they ignored the conflict. When the orcs surged out of the east, the dwarves still remained aloof&mdash;so when the orcs overran Caras Seidharen and Arcis Aurum, the dwarves were able to meet the weakened horde with their full might.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Even this proved insufficient in the face of the orcs&rsquo; savagery: falling back from their eastern borders, the dwarves resorted to luring the orcs towards their heavily-fortified capital, Konigstrond. There, they forced the orcs to fight their way inch-by-inch up the mountainside, until at last they broke through into the royal palace at the mountain&rsquo;s peak.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">It is unclear what precisely happened when the orcs at last entered the High King&rsquo;s throne room&mdash;but shortly afterward, the mountain was shaken by a great tremor, causing the entire face of the mountain to collapse and bury the bulk of the orc horde. The horde was at long last broken, but of High King Torgrim and his heirs and retainers, there was no sign. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The loss of their king&mdash;and of their culture&rsquo;s greatest repositories of knowledge, history, and treasure&mdash;left the dwarven nation sundered. The many clans, once united behind their High King, withdrew into their mountain fastnesses to regain their strength, and wait out the shattered remnants of the orc horde. When they emerged again, a century later, the dwarves were no longer a single people, but a collection of fractious, uncooperative clans. Grievances that had festered for a hundred years boiled over, and the dwarves threatened to make war upon each other.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">This battle was forestalled by Olaf, Thane of Clan Ulfenning, and then one of the oldest dwarves alive: Olaf produced the crown of the High King, which he claimed to have discovered during the retreat from Konigstrond, some ways from the site of the battle. Its presence there meant that Torgrim, or a member of his family, must have escaped from the battle alive&mdash;and thus, claimed Olaf, the dwarves were honor-bound to preserve the kingdom until the rightful High King could be found and placed on the throne.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">This was a justification which allowed the gathered dwarves to set aside their quarrels without breaking oaths or losing face. And so it was that Olaf of Clan Ulfenning was acclaimed as the first Regent for the Unclaimed Throne, and the dwarves set about rebuilding their once-great nation.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The dwarves soon discovered just how much they had lost in the Collapse: many of the great secrets of their ancestors had been jealously guarded in the archives of Konigstrond and lost with the city. They no longer knew the formulas and methods for smelting mithril or adamantine, or many of the runes of power, and much of their history, genealogy, and other records were long-lost. As they realized that they might never reach the heights of their former glory, the dwarves clung all the more tightly to what they still possessed: the relics and fragments of lore which had escaped Konigstrond became treasured artifacts held in trust for all dwarfkind, and when Regent Olaf died&mdash;at an astonishing old age, even for a dwarf&mdash;he was declared the first of many Venerated Ancestors: dwarves who embodied the lost glory of their race, and examples to all those who would follow.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Little has changed in the Dwarven Federation since then: the dwarves continue to seek out scraps of their lost history and clues as to their rightful king, but this means that they have stagnated over the course of almost a millennium, while humanity and even the elves have moved on. Innovators and inventors face an uphill battle among the dwarves, since the knowledge and creations of the ancestors are considered the pinnacle of dwarven excellence&mdash;and replacing the work of an ancestor is considered offensive, even blasphemous, to their descendants. The dwarves still have not rediscovered how their ancestors smelted adamantine (though they have figured out mithril), and many of their great works of engineering still cannot be replicated, even as they fall into disrepair. </span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Politics</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">In the absence of the rightful High King, the dwarves are ruled by a council of Thanes&mdash;the rulers of powerful clans. Membership in the council varies, but for most of its history the council has consisted of between five and twelve Thanes. The Thanes elect a Regent from among their number, who serves until they lose the confidence of their peers. This Regent is considered a first among equals, with the power to negotiate for the collected clans of the Federation when dealing with outsiders and to issue edicts which have the force of law within the Federation, but as they can be overruled by a simple majority on the council, most Regents exercise this power sparingly.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">New Thanes can be elevated to the council by the acclamation of their would-be peers: this is generally taken to mean that the Thanes currently seated on the council must welcome the new member unanimously. Other decisions of significance also require unanimity, although when there is only a single dissenting vote, the matter is sometimes settled by expelling the dissenter from the council so that the vote becomes unanimous.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Clans whose Thane does not sit on the council can gain representation by pledging fealty to a sitting Thane; in practice this is almost automatic, because when new clans are founded, their founder generally swears fealty to their former Thane. In this manner, most of the clans currently in existence &ldquo;descend&rdquo; from one of the seven clans originally seated on the council. Clans are also known to shift their fealty, although it is a step which is not taken lightly: it occurs most often with the permission of a clan&rsquo;s former liege, when all agree that the subordinate clan would be better represented by a different Thane. Less often, a clan changes its allegiance when they feel that their liege has dishonored them in some way; in such cases, the shift of fealty is often followed by the offending Thane being expelled from the council.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Clans control lands within the Ironspine Mountains, although the extent of clans&rsquo; territory varies widely: the largest territories consist of vast stretches of the mountains, while the smallest may only hold a few buildings where a clan lives and works. The size of a clan&rsquo;s territory is only loosely related to the size, prestige or power of the clan; many powerful clans are simply uninterested in the work necessary to police and maintain large tracts of land, choosing instead to focus on other projects. A clan is naturally expected to defend its territory from invaders and lawbreakers; as such, many of the clans which control large areas are those with many warriors.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Society</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Clans are of course the center of dwarven culture: members of a clan work closely with each other, and as a rule they also live, feast, celebrate, and worship together as well.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">A clan is more than just an extended family: it is also an enterprise. Every clan has something which they do for a living: stereotypical clans are miners, metalworkers, engineers, or jewelers, but there are also clans which farm, excavate ancient ruins, operate museums, or interpret the (extremely complicated) dwarven legal code. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Being born into a clan does not dictate what a dwarf does with their life, however. Though many dwarves choose to take up the family trade as a way of honoring their ancestors, a dwarf who has no interest in or talent for the clan&rsquo;s business may seek entry into a clan which is more suitable for them&mdash;with permission from the Thanes of both clans, naturally. Marriage does not require a change of clan (and young dwarves are strongly discouraged from marrying within their clan, to make sure that they aren&rsquo;t marrying a relative): children are permitted to join either of their parents&rsquo; clans when they come of age.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">To found a new clan, a dwarf must first receive permission from their Thane&mdash;who does not have to seek permission from anyone else, strictly speaking, but it is considered wise to get the approval of a Thane on the council before doing so. This permission is generally granted in recognition of some great accomplishment, although it is sometimes used to resolve schisms within a clan, by allowing a disgruntled faction to strike out on their own.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">A clan venerates its ancestors, especially the clan&rsquo;s founder. This status is bestowed by a clan&rsquo;s Stonekeeper&mdash;a position not unlike a priest, although dwarves seldom see it that way. The Stonekeepers keep records of every clan member&rsquo;s notable acts&mdash;for good or for ill&mdash;and, upon a dwarf&rsquo;s death, their clan&rsquo;s Stonekeeper consults the records of their life to determine their worthiness&mdash;some might say dwarfishness. Only a small minority of dwarves achieve the status of Venerated Ancestor and are immortalized in stone, although few dwarves are relegated to obscurity: most simply have their deeds written down in stone and preserved in their clan&rsquo;s records. To be struck from the records entirely&mdash;doomed to be forgotten by their descendants, as dwarves see it&mdash;is a shameful fate reserved only for those who commit some grave transgression.</span></span></p>","_id":"9jHSXk8Wo6rkln01"}

The country broke away from the Novan Imperium eight centuries ago, due to religious strife fueled by an unorthodox interpretation of Deus Ruling&rsquo;s holy text, <em>il Libro del Legge</em>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">History</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">Religion held a great deal of significance in the ancient Auran empire: as humanity lacked large numbers of sorcerers or knowledge of wizardry, the most commonly-seen magic in Arcis Aurum was that of empowered priests, and even they were considerably rarer than they are today. The Auran kings and queens held an assortment of ceremonial positions in various temples and churches, and were revered as living saints or even demigods in certain unorthodox faiths.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">On the other hand, after the Collapse, the early Emperors of the Novan Imperium&mdash;the would-be successors to the Auran Empire&mdash;did not care to share power with priests or temples: they intended to rebuild the Empire in their image, and distrusted the idea of their citizens and soldiers having split loyalties. As a result the early Emperors stamped out any temples that they could not control and use in their campaigns of re-conquest. Those which remained (largely dedicated to militant or law-abiding deities, such as Deum Militant, Deum Valiant, or Deum Ruling) were subordinated to the Imperial government.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">The temples of Deum Ruling were the most content with this arrangement: as followers of the god of law, order, and civilization, they were more than willing to support the Novan Imperium as it became a beacon of civilization in the darkness of the Collapse. The emperors employed the empowered priests of Deum Ruling as arbiters and investigators among their Quaestors&mdash;agents who rooted out corruption and conspiracies in the Novan government&mdash;while the temples&rsquo; rank and file preached obedience to authority.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">This state of affairs persisted through the reigns of the first two emperors, until Gaius III became set upon reclaiming Arcis Aurum itself. His attempt failed catastrophically, but not before certain Quaestors were sent into the orc-inhabited ruins of the once-great city. One of these, a crusader of Deum Ruling by the name of Quintus Palfuria, returned with an ancient text, which he claimed to be the original, divinely-inspired copy of <em>il Libro del Legge,</em> or <em>Book of Laws</em>, recovered from the ruins of the Lexeum, the oldest and greatest of his god&rsquo;s temples.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">Eschewing all assistance from the other members of his order, Quintus undertook the laborious process of translating the holy book from the ancient tongue in which it was written, a process which took years. When he unveiled his finished translation, it sparked riots, as his translation called for the faithful to obey Deum Ruling&rsquo;s priests over all other authorities&mdash;and to remove nonbelievers from authority, by the sword if necessary.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">Not all of Deum Ruling&rsquo;s faithful followed this call&mdash;in fact, many of the god&rsquo;s priests denounced Quintus Palfuria as an incompetent or a self-serving fraud, as his translation matched no previous edition of the <em>Book of Laws</em>. Nonetheless, his message attracted enough followers to form an insurrection which further weakened the Novan Imperium in the aftermath of Gaius III&rsquo;s disastrous reign. The newly-anointed Empress Juliana was willing neither to submit to Palfuria&rsquo;s demands, nor to make a martyr of him: instead, she offered a compromise: Palfuria and his followers were exiled from the central provinces of the Imperium, but would be permitted to preach and to govern themselves (following Novan standards) in the dangerous eastern provinces where orcs still raided on a regular basis. No doubt Juliana hoped that this would make her citizens less eager to join Palfuria, but instead, they embraced it. Palfuria led his followers to settle tracts of land on the eastern border, from which they pushed outwards, conquering additional territory back from the orcs. Although they nominally claimed it for the glory of the Novan Imperium, it rapidly became apparent that this land truly belonged to Palfuria&rsquo;s crusade: between additional converts from the Imperium, and foreign pilgrims who viewed this as Deum Ruling&rsquo;s promised land, the newly-conquered provinces became populated almost exclusively by the god&rsquo;s devoted followers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">Three centuries after the exile, the Palfurian Crusade succeeded in reclaiming Arcis Aurum itself, much to the chagrin of the Novan Imperium. They lavishly restored the ancient temples to Deum Ruling, while tearing down the city&rsquo;s other temples in their process of rebuilding&mdash;and at this point, with the ancient seat of humanity safely in their grasp, the Crusade finally declared its independence from the Imperium, declaring themselves the Sanctean Primarchy and renaming the ancient city as Arx Sanctea.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">The Sancteans have since had several conflicts with the Novan Imperium, culminating in an all-out war during the Wars of Smoke and Steel. Though the Novan Legions were able to conquer parts of the Primarchy in each conflict, they found themselves unable to win the hearts and minds of the inhabitants: despite strict curfews and efforts to disarm the civilian populace, Novan patrols found themselves ambushed by mobs on a regular basis, while in the Imperium, sympathizers committed acts of sabotage and terrorism until it became politically unviable to continue the occupation. The two countries remain in an uneasy peace, with Novan Quaestors and Sanctean zealots regularly coming into conflict with each other at the border.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Politics</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">When the Primarchy gained independence, they structured their government to incorporate the many religious orders that had joined or formed under the banner of the Palfurian Crusade: each order was granted a piece of land, in which their ordained priests would enforce the laws of Deum Ruling. Each of these orders also participates in the election of the Primarch, who is the sole priest permitted to read the original <em>Book of Laws.</em></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">Although all of the orders represented in the Primarchy have accepted Palfuria&rsquo;s translation of the <em>Book of Laws</em>, there is still some variation in how they interpret it. Some of these disagreements are minor: in some parts of Sanctea, it is forbidden to work from sunrise to sundown on holy days, while in others, it is forbidden from one sunrise to the next. Other disagreements are more problematic: certain hardline orders interpret the command to remove nonbelievers from authority as requiring all figures of authority to be ordained priests&mdash;and as such, the priests of this order are reluctant to obey the instructions of un-priestly authorities such as mayors or constables in the domains of less restrictive orders.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">This conflict has only gotten worse as the years pass and new interpretations of the <em>Book of Laws</em> are proposed, to the point that recent Primarchs have instituted an Inquisition to identify heretical interpretations among the many orders. The Inquisition has so far been restricted to policing the clergy, but there are rumors that the High Inquisitor now seeks to be granted authority over the average citizens of the Primarchy. Considering the zeal of the Inquisition, and the tortures that they often put suspected heretics to, many citizens live in fear of this authority being granted.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Society</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">The Primarchy is located in what were once the heartlands of Arcis Aurum. These lands are incredibly fertile, thanks to extensive flood plains and river deltas, and so much of the Primarchy is agrarian. The various religious orders making up the Primarchy own most of the country&rsquo;s farmland, however; they employ farmers to work the land, but keep a large share of the crop for themselves&mdash;both to feed the priesthood, and to fund their charitable and other activities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">Between the charity of various orders of the priesthood, and the presence of many empowered priests with healing magic, even the poorest citizen has a high standard of living compared to other nations: poverty is almost unheard-of, and it is rare that anyone dies of disease or any but the most sudden and violent of accidents. However, this is all dependent upon being a faithful worshipper of Deum Ruling: suspicions of apostasy, blasphemy, or heresy can quickly lead to the loss of one&rsquo;s home, livelihood, or worse. Many of the more fundamentalist and militant orders practice conscription or forced religious re-education within their territories, and others are quick to enforce harsh penalties for perceived violations of Deum Ruling&rsquo;s laws. As the only path to high positions of power is to join the clergy, and strictly follow one of the established interpretations of the <em>Book of Laws</em>, there are few opportunities for free-thinkers or the less-devout to appeal to higher authorities or enact change.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\">Additionally, it is also difficult for citizens to leave Sanctea. Many orders require emigrants to pay steep tithes before leaving, and the great powers are often reluctant to accept Sanctean immigrants, as the Primarchy is known for its use of partisan fighters to spread dissent and conflict. Many who leave Sanctea do so by fleeing in the night, and wind up in lawless places like the Horselands or the Unclaimed Reaches.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>","_id":"JXhESRyhUbArTc5h"}

Many of the Autonomous Clans develop weapons—including sophisticated firearms, alchemical explosives, and powerful enchantments—for sale to the highest bidder, and have much closer relations with outsiders than the rest of the dwarves.

It is a primeval forest, home to small, close-packed villages, and no settlements at all which are larger than a mid-sized town: even the Queen of Tir Coetir rules from a travelling court, which resides in various towns for a few weeks at a time, moving on at the Queen&rsquo;s whim. Outside of a few strongholds where the laws are well-enforced, it can be an unforgiving place to outsiders: many a traveler has gone missing in the deep woods, taken by bandits, nature spirits, or even druidic cults.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 16.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;\">History</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">In the Age of Glory, the ancient elves claimed the densely-forested lands in the northeastern parts of the continent. They were the first race to develop sorcery, and their civilization, Caras Seidharen, rose to great heights based on their command of magic. However, the primacy of magic naturally caused the elves to be ruled by sorcerers: by the Age of Tyrants, a dynasty of despotic sorcerer-kings ruled the elves, and engaged in slavery, blood sports and a variety of dark magics to maintain their rule.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">It was these sorcerer-kings who kicked off the Collapse when they goaded the orcs into attacking their rivals in Arcis Aurum. Having overrun the human kingdom, the orcs proceeded to rampage onward into Caras Seidharen. When they realized the seriousness of their predicament, the ruling class vanished into the realm of Faerie with their most loyal retainers, abandoning the bulk of the elven people.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The elves who survived the Collapse&mdash;mostly those who fled to distant outposts in the west&mdash;fell into two camps: <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>those who rejected arcane magic and the other legacies of Caras Seidharen retreated into the depths of the Great Forest of Tir Coetir, a primeval wilderness which concealed them from the prying eyes of destructive outsiders.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">However, without the magic that had supported Caras Seidharen, these wood elves found themselves struggling to feed themselves. They spent decades attempting to farm on the outskirts of the forest, supplementing their food supply by hunting, foraging, and occasionally breaking down and using arcane magic. These uses of magic inevitably led to mobs and purges by hardline anti-arcanist factions, until a compromise was reached: rather than abandon magic entirely, the wood elves turned to other, older magics. They sought out and appeased spirits of nature, using them to encourage the growth of crops and hunt wild animals through the depths of the forest. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">This use of primal magics changed the wood elves: once sophisticated urbanites like their brethren the high elves, over a handful of generations they embraced their simpler existence, scattering to tiny woodland villages and all but abandoning the small city that they had built at the heart of the forest. They mostly abandoned their traditional religions, with most beginning to worship the spirits that brought them sustenance, and they maintained their isolation by ruthlessly killing any outsiders who ventured too close to their borders without permission&mdash;and such permission was rarely granted. For the rare occasions when they had to communicate or negotiate with outsiders, the wood elves chose to crown a king, who would speak for them but not rule them. After much discussion, they settled on Ceredwyn the Protector, a warrior who had shepherded many refugees safely to their new home. King Ceredwyn leveraged his renown to supplement his formal power and was able to mold the culture of his new nation, but his descendants did not hold the same degree of respect. Over the years the royals were relegated to figureheads, with the true power in Tir Coetir belonging to various local lords and druidic cults.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The wood elves did not face any challenge to their isolationism for centuries, until the beginning of the Wars of Smoke and Steel. While the major powers fought each other, the conflicts of the Petty Kingdoms to the south began to spill over into the forest of Tir Coetir, which the warring warlords believed to be largely uninhabited. At first, the wood elves remained content to let the humans kill each other within their territory (and then mop up the survivors, if necessary), but it soon became apparent that the intruders had no intention of leaving their forest once they had won. The scattered elven villages were initially unable to oppose this encroachment, and were forced to abandon their holdings and flee further into the forest. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">As news of the human incursions spread through the forest realm, warlike elves from throughout Tir Coetir gathered to oppose them, although their efforts only slowed the humans&rsquo; advance into the forest. However, the wood elves&rsquo; current king, Melwyr the Vanquisher, greatly savored his hunts&mdash;and, it was rumored, secretly participated in bloody druidic rituals. He came to view this human invasion as merely a new kind of hunt, and he began to lead vicious hit-and-run attacks which terrorized the human settlers. Faced with a forest which seemed to conceal an archer or a bloody-handed druid behind every tree, the humans eventually fled the forest.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">After this victory, Melwyr enjoyed great acclaim from his subjects, and was able to reclaim some of the respect and glory that King Ceredwyn once held. At the same time, he came to recognize that the wood elves could no longer afford to ignore the outside world entirely. At the conclusion of the Wars of Smoke and Steel, Melwyr unexpectedly began to send ambassadors to the other major powers, and in the end he permitted small numbers of merchants to enter into the forest. Trade with the outside world brought greater prosperity to the wood elves&mdash;but Melwyr also ensured that the merchants saw the skill of his archers and the magic of his druids, and carried the tales to any would-be invaders.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Politics</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Much of the power in Tir Coetir still lies in the many small villages scattered throughout the forest. Thanks to Melwyr&rsquo;s wartime leadership, his daughter Aemalla can call upon her subjects to provide levies of archers or druidic magic for the defense of the woodland realm, but she has little control over the laws and customs of individual villages, which are still ruled by an assortment of hereditary nobles, village councils, and druidic priests. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">More importantly, Aemalla seldom feels the need to exercise her power: she grew up in a time when Tir Coetir was peaceful and prosperous, thanks to renewed trade, and as long as she has access to the luxuries of the outside world&mdash;wine, exotic spices and rich textiles, even some arcane magical conveniences, despite the wood elves&rsquo; general dislike for them&mdash;she is content to spend her days hunting and sporting throughout the woodland realm, leaving actual rulership to local authorities.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">This lax policy has allowed some especially remote parts of Tir Coetir to effectively ignore Melwyr&rsquo;s decrees: these remote settlements no longer contribute soldiers to the defense of the realm, or permit outsiders to pass through peacefully. They have all but officially declared their independence from Aemalla&rsquo;s rule, and she seems perfectly content to let them. In these unruly parts of Tir Coetir, many of the local lords have grown power-mad, abducting travelers to hunt for sport, or to sacrifice to their bloodthirsty patron spirits.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Society</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The wood elves of Tir Coetir live close to nature; even in larger towns, the buildings are built around, or even into, the living trees of the forest. Many wood elves, including the queen herself, are nomadic and travel from village to village as whim or necessity takes them.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Even the non-nomadic wood elves live relatively simple lives, compared to the other great powers. This is partly by choice&mdash;the culture fostered by Ceredwyn the Protector places little value on material objects&mdash;but it is also because the wood elves have little of value to begin with. Their forest contains very little in the way of mineral resources, and those only in the north, at the foothills of the Ironspine mountains. Agriculture is likewise difficult in the deep forest, and so the only goods of value that the elves have are rare woods from the depths of the forest, unusual botanical extracts, and the skins and furs they gain from hunting. There are few merchants among the elves&mdash;craftsmen and gatherers tend to simply sell their own products&mdash;but a growing number of local lords have begun enriching themselves by taxing trade with foreign merchants.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Instead of wealth and lavish lifestyles, the elves of Tir Coetir treasure song and laughter. While they are not exactly communal, their communities are tight-knit and host regular festivals and celebrations with plentiful food, music, dancing, and poetry.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The druids of Tir Coetir are almost a separate people, however. Spirits are affected by mortal perceptions of them, and so many of the spirits in Tir Coetir&mdash;where the elves view them as generous providers&mdash;have grown tame and cooperative. But in the deep parts of the forest, there are spirits which prey upon mortals, reveling in their fear and growing ever more terrible from it. It falls to the druids to contain these spirits: they construct wards to keep dangerous spirits away from villages, and drive them back when they grow too bold&hellip;and when all else fails, appease them with the appropriate sacrifices. The burden of combating these dark spirits is a heavy one, and the druids are both respected and shunned, for though their task is important, it is also unsavory, reminding the wood elves of the price they must pay for isolation.</span></span></p>","_id":"dgQa5qi9I5pY7Mv6"}

Thanks to Waystone’s Royal Navy, which extended its piracy-suppression patrols down the western coast, those pirate dens have been turned into mere fishing villages.

Shipwrecked mariners would be well-advised to surrender their cargoes and accept the villagers’ offer of a hot meal and warm blankets, for the locals still have something of a piratical streak—sailors trying to hold onto their cargo are often “lost to the waves” in suspicious circumstances.</span></span></p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":2,"hsFJxrWN4M5Ezw3L":3,"lh2XdhvmO8rwUMvb":2},"flags":{},"_id":"jN6y3Q37Jl7lzqnZ"}

In the northwest of the continent, numerous &ldquo;barbarian&rdquo; kingdoms flourished, far from the imperial rule of the Aurans. They warred frequently among themselves, and against outposts of the elves, dwarves, and orcs until the beginning of the Collapse.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">When the orcs overran Arcis Aurum and Caras Seidharen, refugees fled west before the oncoming hordes. The refugees who eventually reached what is now Victovy were a hardened bunch, having survived the horrors of the Collapse, but they brought with them knowledge of science, medicine, engineering, and even the rudiments of magic from the east. For a few short years, the northern kingdoms which took them in prospered.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Inevitably, this prosperity came to an end when the orcs followed behind the refugees. Having heard many tales of the orc invaders, most of the northern kingdoms had banded together, and were prepared to fight a desperate defense against the ravening horde&mdash;but instead, they faced innumerable bands of raiders which sought only to pillage and burn, and avoided the attempts to bring them to a decisive battle. This was all that was left of the horde, which had been broken by the last stand of the dwarf king.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The uneasy alliance between the northern kingdoms held together for some years, but when it became obvious that the orcs were no longer a serious threat, the northern kings began to look to their own interests. Before the arrival of the orcs, they had often fought among themselves, and now, having raised larger armies to fend off an invasion which hadn&rsquo;t materialized, they turned on each other.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">For two centuries, the northern kingdoms raided and conquered each other, and the orcs, and the occasional outsiders, and this state of affairs might have persisted if not for Georgei Androv, King of the Victs. Androv was well-known for ruthlessness, and was rumored to have assassinated his way to the throne; certainly his father, uncles, and older sister died untimely deaths, though they were never connected with Georgei. While leading his army against a neighboring rival, Androv discovered a band of orcs taking advantage of the chaos. As was common at the time, Androv called a ceasefire with his rival, and both armies marched upon the orcs&mdash;only for Androv to make common cause with the orcs instead, at which point he and the orcs fell upon and massacred his rival&rsquo;s army.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Pleased with the success of this tactic, Androv swayed these orcs to his side, promising them plunder and tribute&mdash;as long as they refrained from killing too many serfs, and let him claim the lands for himself. This strategy worked alarmingly well, and Androv was cunning enough that he made efforts to integrate the orcs with his own forces. By the end of his lifetime, he had conquered nearly a third of the northern kingdoms, and had subverted several orc tribes into shock troops.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Georgei&rsquo;s successors continued in his footsteps, unifying the northern kingdoms under Victish rule. Most of them were no less cunning than Georgei, and though they continued to expand their borders through conquest (and the threat of the orc regiments), they took pains to integrate their new vassals into their growing empire, taking the strengths of each conquered kingdom and making them their own, rather than imposing Victish culture on their subjects. The kings, and then the imperial Tsars, remained ruthlessly practical, and they had no qualms about adopting any culture, religion, invention, or dogma that they believed would strengthen Victovy, and thus, themselves. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Victovy continued to expand gradually by conquest, annexation, and colonization until the beginning of the Wars of Smoke and Steel, when they were stymied by a coalition led by the much smaller nation of Waystone. The Victovan military juggernaut stumbled as the coalition ignored its armies and instead struck at supply lines and industrial targets far behind the lines, and when the wars ended, Victovy had gained little territory while losing much of its industrial base to sabotage and surgical strikes.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">In the aftermath of the wars, Tsar Nikolaj the Learned adapted quickly to this new paradigm: as demonstrated by Waystone, the Victovan Empire could no longer count on expanding by force of arms alone. Taking inspiration from the diverse coalition that had defeated them, Nikolaj diverted funds from the military towards universities, with the intent of turning Victovy into a beacon of scientific progress. Almost as a side effect, this simultaneously revitalized the nation&rsquo;s arts and culture, and the following years saw a resurgence in the traditional art, music, literature and theater of the empire&rsquo;s many subject peoples.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Nikolaj&rsquo;s attempt to make Victovy the cultural and scientific center of the known world was almost successful: during his reign, and that of his daughter Alexandra, the nation attracted intellectuals and artists from around the world, and the imperial capital of Fedotigrad rivaled Waystone as the most cosmopolitan city in the world. However, the defunding of the Victovan military left many influential officers dissatisfied. Nikolaj and Alexandra kept the army in check by purging officers who grew too outspoken, but unknown to them, a conspiracy began to grow in the upper ranks of the central command.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">The conspiracy found a receptive catspaw in Tsarina Alexandra&rsquo;s younger daughter, Tsareva Galina, who had been sent to the army out of longstanding tradition. Then a mid-ranking officer of no particular talent, she eagerly joined the conspiracy when approached by one of her superior officers. Upon her mother&rsquo;s death, Galina led the palace troops in a coup against her older brother Piotr. Denouncing the crown prince as unfit, due to a &ldquo;weakness of the blood,&rdquo; she ascended to the throne with the backing of the capitol&rsquo;s garrison troops and promptly began issuing decrees for the rebuilding of the Victovan military.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in; tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"tab-stops: right 8.0in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Politics</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Victovy is, and always has been, a despotic dictatorship. The Tsar holds absolute power thanks to the backing of the army&mdash;though as seen recently, when a Tsar loses that backing, their days are numbered.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Victovy has no nobles and no hereditary aristocracy aside from the imperial family: the Tsar appoints governors for each province and offers fiefdoms to effective subordinates, but neither of these are hereditary. However, when Victovy began to industrialize, there arose the <em>boyars</em>, a class of merchants and industrialists who gained power through vast wealth. The Tsars tolerate the boyars, and even heed their counsel, because they are useful, even necessary, to keep the empire strong. The boyars control factories, mills, and laboratories which supply the Victovan military, and though they compete ruthlessly with each other for profit and the favor of the Tsar, they have enough self-preservation to present a united front whenever the Tsar appears eager to seize their fortunes.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Since Tsarina Galina&rsquo;s ascent to the throne, she has had a second group of advisors in the nation&rsquo;s High Command. These high-ranking officers control crucial regiments, and Galina&rsquo;s reign is dependent on keeping their support&mdash;not that she has much difficulty doing so, for as a former officer herself, she shares many of their opinions. However, as she grows used to ruling, she is less and less beholden to the officers who backed her rise, and there are signs that her conspirators are losing their influence over her decisions. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Much of the High Command openly yearns for a new war to encourage patriotic fervor&mdash;and privately, they expect to grow rich from the spoils of war. The boyars, understanding that the war effort will likely be costly in the short term, oppose this aggression, and are dragging their feet when it comes to producing the war materiel demanded by the High Command. Very soon, tensions will come to a head.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt;\">Society</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">For much of Victovy&rsquo;s history, the bulk of the population were serfs bound to the land and subject to the whims of whichever governor or friend of the Tsar had been appointed to rule them. To discourage peasant uprisings, serfs were barred from learning to read, owning property (and especially weapons), or travelling without special dispensations. Their sole path to prosperity was to enlist in the military, or be conscripted, and serve with distinction. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">In the years between the Wars of Smoke and Steel and Tsarina Galina&rsquo;s coup, it became possible for serfs to escape their drudgery through education as scholars or artists. Although it was only the talented few who benefited from this, it did create a growing middle class&mdash;one that now suffers under Galina&rsquo;s reign. The diversion of funds to the military build-up resulted in many intellectuals losing their livelihoods, and when they protested this and the resumption of universal conscription, they became the targets of a purge. Many of the artists and scientists who were once drawn to Victovy have now fled the country, and most of those who remain are sheltered by boyars who exploit their work. A few have begun to form a resistance movement, and are now hunted by the Tsarina&rsquo;s secret police.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent: .25in;\"><span class=\"RPGMaterial\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-font-size: 12.0pt;\">Despite these purges and persecutions, the new government&rsquo;s propaganda campaigns have led to a resurgence of militaristic fervor, convincing the average citizen that Victovy is surrounded by jealous enemies who are simultaneously powerful enough to threaten the empire, and weak enough that a glorious victory is assured. This combination has led to the desired result of mass enlistment in Galina&rsquo;s growing army.</span></span></p>","_id":"zrLpOtSLsUWptEui"}
